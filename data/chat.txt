[2020-10-30 14:39:17] <moobot> Bob Ross (October 29, 1942 – July 4, 1995) was an American painter, art instructor, and television host. He was best known as the creator and host of The Joy of Painting, an instructional television program that aired from 1983 to 1994 on PBS. Bob was diagnosed with lymphoma in the early 1990s, which eventually forced his retirement after The Joy of Painting's final episode aired on May 17, 1994. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Ross

[2020-10-30 15:10:58] <moobot> Bob Ross (October 29, 1942 – July 4, 1995) was an American painter, art instructor, and television host. He was best known as the creator and host of The Joy of Painting, an instructional television program that aired from 1983 to 1994 on PBS. Bob was diagnosed with lymphoma in the early 1990s, which eventually forced his retirement after The Joy of Painting's final episode aired on May 17, 1994. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Ross

[2020-10-30 16:12:36] <beastongaming> Saying "ruined" is a joke because whenever bob paints a tree or rock, he risks ruining the painting. They aren't actually saying it's ruined
[2020-10-30 16:12:52] <zwerge122> exactly hahh
[2020-10-30 16:13:03] <mr_butter112> Oh okay, gotcha

[2020-10-30 16:37:24] <moobot> Bob Ross (October 29, 1942 – July 4, 1995) was an American painter, art instructor, and television host. He was best known as the creator and host of The Joy of Painting, an instructional television program that aired from 1983 to 1994 on PBS. Bob was diagnosed with lymphoma in the early 1990s, which eventually forced his retirement after The Joy of Painting's final episode aired on May 17, 1994. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Ross

[2020-10-30 17:07:34] <moobot> Bob Ross (October 29, 1942 – July 4, 1995) was an American painter, art instructor, and television host. He was best known as the creator and host of The Joy of Painting, an instructional television program that aired from 1983 to 1994 on PBS. Bob was diagnosed with lymphoma in the early 1990s, which eventually forced his retirement after The Joy of Painting's final episode aired on May 17, 1994. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Ross

[2020-10-30 17:40:35] <darth_mc_peepants> @bnotagamer27 you should have seen the bald black half white he did earlier!
[2020-10-30 17:40:47] <carrieanncarebear> @asharya15 I have been facinated with his paintings and teachings since I was a young child

[2020-10-30 18:24:37] <moobot> Bob Ross (October 29, 1942 – July 4, 1995) was an American painter, art instructor, and television host. He was best known as the creator and host of The Joy of Painting, an instructional television program that aired from 1983 to 1994 on PBS. Bob was diagnosed with lymphoma in the early 1990s, which eventually forced his retirement after The Joy of Painting's final episode aired on May 17, 1994. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Ross

[2020-10-30 18:46:51] <happychappy008> @darth_mc_peepants series 9 (can't remember what episode) he did 5 cabins. It was a moment of glory
[2020-10-30 18:46:57] <darth_mc_peepants> @jscuk actually, Bob is still painting every day through those of us who have taken his teaching to heart
[2020-10-30 18:47:13] <thegreatgamer28> Hello
[2020-10-30 18:47:24] <alathic> @natigarden But you need dark in order to show the light.

[2020-10-30 18:47:28] <bobtheephemeral> I know you mean well deleting that, but it's actually insensitive and archaic to stigmatize injuries and birth defects. There's nothing wrong with not being the same as everyone and it alienates people to treat it like a negative thing

[2020-10-30 19:13:25] <balforedelfuego> thats my question. When did he start saying: God Bless. Its not in his earlier recordings. He also didnt day "God Bless You", he would say "God Bless" in later vids
[2020-10-30 19:13:56] <vexatii0nzz_> one of those days huh
[2020-10-30 19:14:09] <bigbroso> sometimes he also says "god bless, my friend"
[2020-10-30 19:14:14] <rastadamas> It *is* in some of his earlier recordings. He says it when he wants to.
[2020-10-30 19:14:14] <frantikchaos> I’m watching bob on pbs right now. He just did the classic bravery test.
