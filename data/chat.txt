[2020-10-30 21:09:21] <humanhairball> so we are going to put mustard on a swan before the day is out
[2020-10-30 21:09:22] <lachicalolita> "Key's already heavily into the BSL" is not a phrase I expected to hear.
[2020-10-30 21:09:27] <spanners_x> Much love raiders - donation link in the text on the right of the about bit.
[2020-10-30 21:09:30] <murrayhannon> Took me way too long to figure out what BSL means... I'm American. If that's an excuse.
[2020-10-30 21:09:30] <vultmog> @aaron24wood I'm happy to help!
[2020-10-30 21:09:30] <tinytardigrade> ahhaha
[2020-10-30 21:09:31] <eelobrian> by the end Tim Key will be doing the BSL
[2020-10-30 21:09:32] <stevencgr> well no, people can see Tim signing. they can also read the chat, so no need for VSL for visual things.

[2020-10-31 00:04:14] <flumcake> Essentially Mark is going to create the same look he‚Äôll naturally have in about 21 hours.
[2020-10-31 00:04:30] <emmad1978> toothpaste good for spots. but not a scientist
[2020-10-31 00:04:30] <larastockley> watson looks like a 5 year old at the beach
[2020-10-31 00:04:33] <ralphhurricane> Took Key more than 25 seconds to get his toothpaste

[2020-10-31 00:04:34] <tobyloveszooey> Key has toothpaste?
[2020-10-31 00:04:39] <missgroucher> I put toothpaste on my face when I was a teenager because I thought it would help with spots. It was a REALLY bad idea
[2020-10-31 00:04:40] <chrisdfawcett> can we get toothpaste on a duck in bsl?
[2020-10-31 00:04:46] <pathjill> Oof- toothpaste on the face will not seem like a good idea tomorrow
[2020-10-31 00:04:51] <aaron24wood> Key using a brush technique...
[2020-10-31 00:04:53] <lachicalolita> It's a bit blue...

[2020-10-31 00:05:10] <carsmilesteve> no blue on the stream!
[2020-10-31 00:05:12] <flumcake> Putting toothpaste on your face is a mint idea.
[2020-10-31 00:05:14] <dmplayin> add some talc
[2020-10-31 00:05:14] <longshowlifer> methinks key has done this before...

[2020-10-31 00:05:57] <yinzerpincer> key is clearly realizing his mistake
[2020-10-31 00:05:58] <cieran1982> It was an after party for the gig and i was playing guitar unaware my mic was on
[2020-10-31 00:05:58] <bitparade> there is (or was) a picture of me in full zombie makeup on the BBC news website

[2020-10-31 02:31:53] <howlietee> Is this only going to end when Colt is actually naked?
[2020-10-31 02:31:55] <mrs_peas> IMHO David should keep checking the remaining protection offered to his junk by continuing to hit himself in the penis

[2020-10-31 02:50:00] <kaipage> Second survey to answer for Cerys here: https://forms.gle/d4aBMrgVvfDNquR9A
[2020-10-31 02:50:04] <surubil> I know it as fluffy bunnies
[2020-10-31 02:50:04] <devbear> <3
[2020-10-31 02:50:05] <probablylucy> Say 'Mustard On A Swan'
[2020-10-31 02:50:08] <ajpanos> You die only if you're bad at the game
[2020-10-31 02:50:12] <kaipage> @howlieTee I am too! I think my posture isn't helping it either
[2020-10-31 02:50:14] <devbear> @howlietee coffee time?
[2020-10-31 02:50:18] <daveogray> Mustard on a Swan baby @probablylucy
[2020-10-31 02:50:19] <giantbaystacks> @howlieTee I am struggling to be honest.
[2020-10-31 02:50:24] <martingmcg> That date is definitely a choke hazard
[2020-10-31 02:50:26] <twinkfarmer> colt would never cheat! the slander!
[2020-10-31 02:50:26] <m7mdxxxpunk> Colt should've bought tiny grape
[2020-10-31 02:50:28] <mr_sping> Blimey, someone's just died
[2020-10-31 02:50:28] <ajpanos> @probablylucy best idea
[2020-10-31 02:50:32] <yinzerpincer> bad idea
[2020-10-31 02:50:36] <howlietee> @kaipage ooo it could be postur #e
[2020-10-31 02:50:38] <yinzerpincer> don't choke
[2020-10-31 02:50:44] <kayjupe> @howlieTee I've had a few bevs, few energy drinks and I'm somehow still standing, if not yawny
[2020-10-31 02:50:45] <24hrbarney> "I don't think anyone will die doing it"
[2020-10-31 02:50:47] <pokebex> I‚Äôm bleary eyes in the last 10mins
[2020-10-31 02:50:47] <martingmcg> Although it wouldn't be the first date I've choked on
[2020-10-31 02:50:50] <howlietee> @devbear currently sipping a can of coke because I‚Äôm trapped by a cat
[2020-10-31 02:50:51] <danihausens> not even a nip on the way out
[2020-10-31 02:50:59] <devbear> yo I'm a nurse and I love the show, but like, please don't choke
[2020-10-31 02:51:00] <kaipage> @howlieTee I know it happens with me when my neck is too tense etc
[2020-10-31 02:51:00] <howlietee> @giantbaystacks but you‚Äôre poorly, sleep@is allowed!
[2020-10-31 02:51:03] <shiksaaaah69> colt's got the biggest grapes
[2020-10-31 02:51:06] <ashaschaos> @martingmcg ha ha ha
[2020-10-31 02:51:06] <mr_sping> Grapes compress in a way that marshmallows don't. Should be fine.
[2020-10-31 02:51:09] <twinkfarmer> @danihausens donations for nips
[2020-10-31 02:51:17] <devbear> @howlietee do you need the police?
[2020-10-31 02:51:22] <sjyoung1967> Any NextUpFam still awake on here?
[2020-10-31 02:51:23] <danihausens> now he's got a shirt
[2020-10-31 02:51:27] <danihausens> smh
[2020-10-31 02:51:30] <devbear> @mr_sping not if they inhale them whole
[2020-10-31 02:51:34] <hols_79> OMG you have to watch the comedy short 'Chubby Bunny' by Stuart Laws/Turtle Canyon, it's fucking hilarious
[2020-10-31 02:51:36] <probablylucy> grapes and a shirt
[2020-10-31 02:51:37] <devbear> grapes are very slippery
[2020-10-31 02:51:38] <jacknobbledy> I can't make the donating work. Not sure if that's the site broken or me just being drunk
[2020-10-31 02:51:43] <pokebex> Colt put clothes on. Boooo
[2020-10-31 02:51:44] <serena1975> My phone is on 7% and I'm too tired to go downstairs to recharge it.
[2020-10-31 02:51:45] <howlietee> @kaipage mines a nightmare, too much driving earlier
[2020-10-31 02:51:52] <betterbreakforce> @danihausens we are just getting further and further from nips here
[2020-10-31 02:51:52] <maddiegauci> I don't think we want to see that!
[2020-10-31 02:51:54] <shiksaaaah69> lmfao DAMMIT BANANA
[2020-10-31 02:51:55] <devbear> oh god I can't watch üòÇ
[2020-10-31 02:51:59] <m7mdxxxpunk> he actually went out & got new grapes
[2020-10-31 02:52:06] <mr_sping> @Devbear I didn't think about the inhaling potential
[2020-10-31 02:52:08] <josierustle> this is not gonna end well
[2020-10-31 02:52:08] <kaipage> @jacknobbledy What's the problem you're having?
[2020-10-31 02:52:09] <danihausens> @BetterBreakforce he truly hates us
[2020-10-31 02:52:12] <howlietee> @devbear nah I can cope, she‚Äôs all soft and cuddly
[2020-10-31 02:52:17] <pokebex> What so you expect from the dark order
[2020-10-31 02:52:21] <devbear> @mr_sping Aye that's my worry with the speaking!
[2020-10-31 02:52:25] <sashajademua> someone's definitely gunna choke
[2020-10-31 02:52:27] <martingmcg> This could be a handy test of the relative efficiency of the emergency services in different countries
[2020-10-31 02:52:28] <mr_sping> Don't deflate your grapes

[2020-10-31 02:52:39] <ledavi> Colt is definitely in the top two professional wrestlers in a 24 hour show
[2020-10-31 02:52:40] <devbear> please do not inhale the grapes
[2020-10-31 02:52:41] <ashaschaos> Can you swallow?
[2020-10-31 02:52:41] <probablylucy> Don't swallow the grapes

[2020-10-31 02:53:02] <m7mdxxxpunk> this is onlyfans content .. this is worse than the clothes segment
[2020-10-31 02:53:05] <howlietee> This is a game that really wants Guy Kelly involved, I know he‚Äôs due later
[2020-10-31 02:53:06] <probablylucy> Do not eat grapes
[2020-10-31 02:53:09] <deadmensboots> I hope we all have someone nearby for the Heimlich?
[2020-10-31 02:53:12] <devbear> genuinely worried üòÇ
[2020-10-31 02:53:15] <sashajademua> we're all so scared someone's gunna die

[2020-10-31 02:53:37] <martingmcg> This is probably a bad time to make them laugh.
[2020-10-31 02:53:38] <devbear> if you need to self heimlich then ball your fists just under your rip cage and squeeze upwards and inwards hard and sharp..
[2020-10-31 02:53:42] <fishlord__> colton has a large mouth
[2020-10-31 02:53:45] <devbear> rib^

[2020-10-31 02:54:14] <sylkensomers> @howlietee let's make him top that later
[2020-10-31 02:54:15] <kaipage> @howlieTee *blushes*
