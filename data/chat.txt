[2020-10-30 21:09:22] <lachicalolita> "Key's already heavily into the BSL" is not a phrase I expected to hear.
[2020-10-30 21:09:27] <spanners_x> Much love raiders - donation link in the text on the right of the about bit.
[2020-10-30 21:09:30] <murrayhannon> Took me way too long to figure out what BSL means... I'm American. If that's an excuse.
[2020-10-30 21:09:30] <vultmog> @aaron24wood I'm happy to help!
[2020-10-30 21:09:30] <tinytardigrade> ahhaha
[2020-10-30 21:09:31] <eelobrian> by the end Tim Key will be doing the BSL
[2020-10-30 21:09:32] <stevencgr> well no, people can see Tim signing. they can also read the chat, so no need for VSL for visual things.

[2020-10-31 00:04:14] <flumcake> Essentially Mark is going to create the same look he‚Äôll naturally have in about 21 hours.
[2020-10-31 00:04:30] <emmad1978> toothpaste good for spots. but not a scientist
[2020-10-31 00:04:30] <larastockley> watson looks like a 5 year old at the beach
[2020-10-31 00:04:33] <ralphhurricane> Took Key more than 25 seconds to get his toothpaste

[2020-10-31 00:04:34] <tobyloveszooey> Key has toothpaste?
[2020-10-31 00:04:39] <missgroucher> I put toothpaste on my face when I was a teenager because I thought it would help with spots. It was a REALLY bad idea
[2020-10-31 00:04:40] <chrisdfawcett> can we get toothpaste on a duck in bsl?
[2020-10-31 00:04:46] <pathjill> Oof- toothpaste on the face will not seem like a good idea tomorrow

[2020-10-31 00:05:10] <carsmilesteve> no blue on the stream!
[2020-10-31 00:05:12] <flumcake> Putting toothpaste on your face is a mint idea.
[2020-10-31 00:05:14] <dmplayin> add some talc
[2020-10-31 00:05:14] <longshowlifer> methinks key has done this before...

[2020-10-31 00:05:57] <yinzerpincer> key is clearly realizing his mistake
[2020-10-31 00:05:58] <cieran1982> It was an after party for the gig and i was playing guitar unaware my mic was on
[2020-10-31 00:05:58] <bitparade> there is (or was) a picture of me in full zombie makeup on the BBC news website

[2020-10-31 02:50:00] <kaipage> Second survey to answer for Cerys here: https://forms.gle/d4aBMrgVvfDNquR9A
[2020-10-31 02:50:04] <surubil> I know it as fluffy bunnies
[2020-10-31 02:50:04] <devbear> <3
[2020-10-31 02:50:05] <probablylucy> Say 'Mustard On A Swan'
[2020-10-31 02:50:08] <ajpanos> You die only if you're bad at the game
[2020-10-31 02:50:12] <kaipage> @howlieTee I am too! I think my posture isn't helping it either
[2020-10-31 02:50:14] <devbear> @howlietee coffee time?
[2020-10-31 02:50:18] <daveogray> Mustard on a Swan baby @probablylucy
[2020-10-31 02:50:19] <giantbaystacks> @howlieTee I am struggling to be honest.
[2020-10-31 02:50:24] <martingmcg> That date is definitely a choke hazard
[2020-10-31 02:50:26] <twinkfarmer> colt would never cheat! the slander!
[2020-10-31 02:50:26] <m7mdxxxpunk> Colt should've bought tiny grape
[2020-10-31 02:50:28] <mr_sping> Blimey, someone's just died
[2020-10-31 02:50:28] <ajpanos> @probablylucy best idea
[2020-10-31 02:50:32] <yinzerpincer> bad idea
[2020-10-31 02:50:36] <howlietee> @kaipage ooo it could be postur #e
[2020-10-31 02:50:38] <yinzerpincer> don't choke
[2020-10-31 02:50:44] <kayjupe> @howlieTee I've had a few bevs, few energy drinks and I'm somehow still standing, if not yawny
[2020-10-31 02:50:45] <24hrbarney> "I don't think anyone will die doing it"
[2020-10-31 02:50:47] <pokebex> I‚Äôm bleary eyes in the last 10mins
[2020-10-31 02:50:47] <martingmcg> Although it wouldn't be the first date I've choked on
[2020-10-31 02:50:50] <howlietee> @devbear currently sipping a can of coke because I‚Äôm trapped by a cat
[2020-10-31 02:50:51] <danihausens> not even a nip on the way out
[2020-10-31 02:50:59] <devbear> yo I'm a nurse and I love the show, but like, please don't choke
[2020-10-31 02:51:00] <kaipage> @howlieTee I know it happens with me when my neck is too tense etc
[2020-10-31 02:51:00] <howlietee> @giantbaystacks but you‚Äôre poorly, sleep@is allowed!
[2020-10-31 02:51:03] <shiksaaaah69> colt's got the biggest grapes
[2020-10-31 02:51:06] <ashaschaos> @martingmcg ha ha ha
[2020-10-31 02:51:06] <mr_sping> Grapes compress in a way that marshmallows don't. Should be fine.
[2020-10-31 02:51:09] <twinkfarmer> @danihausens donations for nips
[2020-10-31 02:51:17] <devbear> @howlietee do you need the police?
[2020-10-31 02:51:22] <sjyoung1967> Any NextUpFam still awake on here?
[2020-10-31 02:51:23] <danihausens> now he's got a shirt
[2020-10-31 02:51:27] <danihausens> smh
[2020-10-31 02:51:30] <devbear> @mr_sping not if they inhale them whole
[2020-10-31 02:51:34] <hols_79> OMG you have to watch the comedy short 'Chubby Bunny' by Stuart Laws/Turtle Canyon, it's fucking hilarious
[2020-10-31 02:51:36] <probablylucy> grapes and a shirt
[2020-10-31 02:51:37] <devbear> grapes are very slippery
[2020-10-31 02:51:38] <jacknobbledy> I can't make the donating work. Not sure if that's the site broken or me just being drunk
[2020-10-31 02:51:43] <pokebex> Colt put clothes on. Boooo
[2020-10-31 02:51:44] <serena1975> My phone is on 7% and I'm too tired to go downstairs to recharge it.
[2020-10-31 02:51:45] <howlietee> @kaipage mines a nightmare, too much driving earlier
[2020-10-31 02:51:52] <betterbreakforce> @danihausens we are just getting further and further from nips here
[2020-10-31 02:51:52] <maddiegauci> I don't think we want to see that!
[2020-10-31 02:51:54] <shiksaaaah69> lmfao DAMMIT BANANA
[2020-10-31 02:51:55] <devbear> oh god I can't watch üòÇ
[2020-10-31 02:51:59] <m7mdxxxpunk> he actually went out & got new grapes
[2020-10-31 02:52:06] <mr_sping> @Devbear I didn't think about the inhaling potential
[2020-10-31 02:52:08] <josierustle> this is not gonna end well
[2020-10-31 02:52:08] <kaipage> @jacknobbledy What's the problem you're having?
[2020-10-31 02:52:09] <danihausens> @BetterBreakforce he truly hates us
[2020-10-31 02:52:12] <howlietee> @devbear nah I can cope, she‚Äôs all soft and cuddly
[2020-10-31 02:52:17] <pokebex> What so you expect from the dark order
[2020-10-31 02:52:21] <devbear> @mr_sping Aye that's my worry with the speaking!
[2020-10-31 02:52:25] <sashajademua> someone's definitely gunna choke
[2020-10-31 02:52:27] <martingmcg> This could be a handy test of the relative efficiency of the emergency services in different countries
[2020-10-31 02:52:28] <mr_sping> Don't deflate your grapes

[2020-10-31 02:52:39] <ledavi> Colt is definitely in the top two professional wrestlers in a 24 hour show
[2020-10-31 02:52:40] <devbear> please do not inhale the grapes
[2020-10-31 02:52:41] <ashaschaos> Can you swallow?
[2020-10-31 02:52:41] <probablylucy> Don't swallow the grapes

[2020-10-31 02:53:02] <m7mdxxxpunk> this is onlyfans content .. this is worse than the clothes segment
[2020-10-31 02:53:05] <howlietee> This is a game that really wants Guy Kelly involved, I know he‚Äôs due later
[2020-10-31 02:53:06] <probablylucy> Do not eat grapes
[2020-10-31 02:53:09] <deadmensboots> I hope we all have someone nearby for the Heimlich?

[2020-10-31 02:53:37] <martingmcg> This is probably a bad time to make them laugh.
[2020-10-31 02:53:38] <devbear> if you need to self heimlich then ball your fists just under your rip cage and squeeze upwards and inwards hard and sharp..
[2020-10-31 02:53:42] <fishlord__> colton has a large mouth

[2020-10-31 02:54:14] <sylkensomers> @howlietee let's make him top that later

[2020-10-31 07:45:21] <quizlacey> i suppose depending on the age of the mustard and how long the jar has been open, putting mustard on a swan could result in a sticky beak...

[2020-10-31 10:53:34] <devbear> Tracey hype!
[2020-10-31 10:53:35] <fishlord__> I like submarine with Auslan
[2020-10-31 10:53:37] <kayjupe> "fuck you" and "holiday" are very similar to be fair
[2020-10-31 10:53:43] <devbear> üòÇ
[2020-10-31 10:53:44] <quizlacey> of course you weigh the eggs
[2020-10-31 10:53:46] <wignomore> weigh my eggs is definitely a euphemism
[2020-10-31 10:53:51] <24hrbarney> You've got to weigh your eggs!
[2020-10-31 10:53:51] <flumcake> Weighing an egg. IS THIS A FALSE BAKER?!
[2020-10-31 10:53:53] <josierustle> i wanna know what the other interpreters favourite words to sign are!
[2020-10-31 10:53:55] <adamlarter> apparently "GOLD" is really fun to sign
[2020-10-31 10:53:55] <longshowlifer> never seen anyone weigh an egg on gbbo.
[2020-10-31 10:53:58] <ungamelyemma> baking wise - just making ice cream bread and I've made some salted popcorn I'm willing to throw some mustard powder into
[2020-10-31 10:54:03] <shineeye> i arrived in time for the bakers!!!
[2020-10-31 10:54:04] <triking77> Has Key ever handled baking ingredients before?
[2020-10-31 10:54:04] <quizlacey> canh't have proper equal quantities of ingerdients if you don't weight the eggs
[2020-10-31 10:54:15] <geertzilla> gotta whey your eggs if you want that real protein
[2020-10-31 10:54:15] <devbear> timmy go for equal amounts of flour, sugar and butter
[2020-10-31 10:54:17] <kayjupe> @adamlarter Bit of an effort to do the whole Spandau song though
[2020-10-31 10:54:21] <quizlacey> @longshowlifer I got this tip from someone weighing them on GBBO!
[2020-10-31 10:54:22] <ali3ghouse> We've only gone and got the bakers! @shineeye
[2020-10-31 10:54:23] <twoowi> weighing eggs is a thing! i feel I should defend Michael
[2020-10-31 10:54:24] <djchizzles> weighing eggs should be a given - eggo consistency is crucial
[2020-10-31 10:54:25] <alexbrewtiful> Try putting Helium in the eggs Kappa

[2020-10-31 10:54:41] <fishlord__> key can gauge an eggs weight
[2020-10-31 10:54:41] <rossvanderh> If you do a bird podcast you need to get comfortable with weighing eggs
[2020-10-31 10:54:42] <magicfrog100> I'd like to see an egg poached in the microwave please.
[2020-10-31 10:54:43] <tasbo75> Terribly sorry I‚Äôm just cracking my eggs
[2020-10-31 10:54:45] <jacletsghost> oh I just joined and we have bakers!!
[2020-10-31 10:55:02] <lachicalolita> You can control the temperature better on a poached egg in a microwave.
[2020-10-31 10:55:08] <savisonline> I'll buy a t-shirt with "weigh your eggs" on it
[2020-10-31 10:55:15] <kayjupe> Never has "being Tim Key" sounded like such a pro and a con simultaneously
[2020-10-31 10:55:16] <bethanyll> @Magicfrog100 Alex Horne does it on Catsdown
[2020-10-31 10:55:17] <fishlord__> what about the water tornado üå™Ô∏è for the poaching
[2020-10-31 10:55:18] <lachicalolita> Tim Key Does Not Weigh Eggs.
[2020-10-31 10:55:20] <devbear> We do NOT weigh our eggs in this house

[2020-10-31 10:56:38] <ljusbrunn> weigh your eggs though
[2020-10-31 10:56:38] <franimall> @shinnyshinykey bloody bakers, that's who
[2020-10-31 10:56:48] <larastockley> did you know, eggs from the uk would be illegal to sell in the US and eggs from the US would be illegal to sell in the UK #eggfacts
[2020-10-31 10:56:51] <flumcake> Baking is easy! Everything is 200g!

[2020-10-31 10:56:55] <chrisdfawcett> 200g is going to be mentioned a lot I feel

[2020-10-31 10:57:18] <24hrbarney> The donation can be any size, but must be the weight of four eggs!

[2020-10-31 10:57:21] <mrsbottom> @larastockley why is that?

[2020-10-31 10:57:24] <lachicalolita> I am oddly impressed that Tim Key owns a sieve.
[2020-10-31 10:57:25] <savisonline> Glad to have helped.

[2020-10-31 10:57:52] <aleatoiiree> no milk!
[2020-10-31 10:57:56] <larastockley> because in the US they clean the eggs and in the UK we don't
[2020-10-31 10:58:01] <rossvanderh> Briony is cracking a fat
[2020-10-31 10:58:02] <longshowlifer> 200g vanilla essence.
[2020-10-31 10:58:07] <aleatoiiree> they clean eggs in the us? crazy

[2020-10-31 10:58:24] <franimall> do they eat shell in USA
[2020-10-31 10:58:35] <josierustle> that would be amazing

[2020-10-31 10:58:44] <twoowi> @larastockley thanks!
[2020-10-31 10:58:48] <shinnyshinykey> Key has a sieve and vanilla essence. Have we entered a parallel universe?
[2020-10-31 10:58:48] <devbear> yeah if you want a boring cake
[2020-10-31 10:58:50] <quizlacey> 200g of vanilla pods
[2020-10-31 10:58:54] <lachicalolita> I'm getting flashbacks to the meal Key cooked for Alex Horne on Taskmaster.
[2020-10-31 10:58:54] <rossvanderh> Vanilleressence is my favorite emo band
[2020-10-31 10:58:54] <larastockley> thats the only egg fact i know, but youre welcome to it
[2020-10-31 10:58:57] <24hrbarney> Or, keep a jar of caster sugar with a vanilla pod in it...
[2020-10-31 10:58:58] <fishlord__> chilli!

[2020-10-31 10:59:14] <lachicalolita> Can you make Victoria Sponge with Um-Bongo?
[2020-10-31 10:59:15] <longshowlifer> impressive if anyone owns 200g of vanilla essence.
[2020-10-31 10:59:23] <magnificentjosh> 200 egg-weight of bicarb
[2020-10-31 10:59:26] <josierustle> i don't think i've ever seen anyone bake with a cap on before

[2020-10-31 12:33:11] <andrewmccafferty> pedant alert: a subspecies is not the same as being in the same genus, frogs and toads are different species

[2020-10-31 12:33:12] <kayjupe> My favourite Depeche Mode song is Toad You So

[2020-10-31 12:38:51] <someblokefromsomewhere> Eggs is a fair point. "Frogs" release eggs wherever they can when they need to. "Toads" will wait until they find a viable waterbody. (Kind of destroys my previous understanding that they're both the same).

[2020-10-31 13:06:35] <kayjupe> Amazingly, that got caught by AutoMod
[2020-10-31 13:06:50] <devbear> @kayjupe üòÇ I don't wanna upset the mods, we've been here together for so long and they've been doing a good job.
[2020-10-31 13:07:00] <djchizzles> no mods upset here <3
[2020-10-31 13:07:11] <kayjupe> @Devbear Never upset the mods, but the robots can go away in harsher words
[2020-10-31 13:07:23] <ashaschaos> Didn't see that coming
[2020-10-31 13:07:27] <devbear> @djchizzles <3 Thank you for your work so far to the whole mod team! I hope you're all keeping hydrated and somewhat sane!

[2020-10-31 13:07:47] <kayjupe> @flumcake funny you should mention that...
[2020-10-31 13:07:52] <dingusbell> Crime solving prostitutes sound amazing!
[2020-10-31 13:08:00] <franimall> @flumcake there maybe some in a Soho book store
[2020-10-31 13:08:02] <devbear> it's online üòÇ
[2020-10-31 13:08:15] <sylkensomers> words mean things
[2020-10-31 13:08:16] <djchizzles> Crime solving prostitutes...would that be TJ Hookers?
[2020-10-31 13:08:23] <josierustle> a better question: will tim actually finish it?
[2020-10-31 13:08:27] <mr_browns_dad> Terribly sorry, but I had to go to the shops, but I see Fitzhigham is there again. Did we find out what McCoy said???
[2020-10-31 13:08:28] <pr00gs> Aaaaannndddd he's off!
[2020-10-31 13:08:33] <ashaschaos> @djchizzles lol
[2020-10-31 13:08:39] <kayjupe> It's the ONLY Anglia
[2020-10-31 13:08:39] <flumcake> At least you‚Äôd already be wearing a mask when you went into the store.
[2020-10-31 13:08:45] <mrsbottom> these days
[2020-10-31 13:08:47] <kayjupe> Even though it includes Clacton
[2020-10-31 13:08:47] <franimall> @mr_browns_dad sadly no
[2020-10-31 13:08:50] <teacake2000> I can't believe you've involved Fitzhigham in this game
[2020-10-31 13:08:53] <discoagogogoch> i want to know what Vix is drinking
[2020-10-31 13:08:54] <leeky> It's better than when it was called "One"
[2020-10-31 13:08:54] <ashaschaos> Yes second that about Greater Anglia
[2020-10-31 13:09:00] <sophie_jiffy> Biggest test is to stay awake during this anecdote
[2020-10-31 13:09:02] <rflanagan2000> Tim will finish anecdote but not necessarily in this life
[2020-10-31 13:09:03] <haiminh_> Expecting FitzHigham's wifi to suddenly shit the bed during this story
[2020-10-31 13:09:05] <hulloelle> paul is killing it
[2020-10-31 13:09:07] <haiminh_> And then come back

[2020-10-31 13:09:29] <josierustle> tim's just gone on a rant
[2020-10-31 13:09:33] <devbear> absolutely blood cheek of it

[2020-10-31 13:09:43] <larastockley> @ndrwtylr mention this again! this needs to be seen
[2020-10-31 13:09:44] <viperswife> is this even the anecdote yet? or has he gone off on a tangent
[2020-10-31 13:09:53] <discoagogogoch> YUM!

[2020-10-31 14:22:29] <fox57893> he's the bbc guy
[2020-10-31 14:22:29] <mrsbottom> absolutely joke of a country
[2020-10-31 14:22:35] <almot200> Dopleganger
[2020-10-31 14:22:35] <caracompass> boris is doing a briefing at 5pm today so we may all get to share horrible news together
[2020-10-31 14:22:39] <devbear> I'm not someone who needs BSL but I am a disabled person and we love seeing accessibility included as a forethought rather than
[2020-10-31 14:22:42] <andrewmccafferty> @thatgirlcan Glad we‚Äôve got some validation now! Any thoughts on the government briefings people?
[2020-10-31 14:22:42] <ashaschaos> I think they are just starting to
[2020-10-31 14:22:46] <devbear> the latter
[2020-10-31 14:22:48] <kayjupe> Just saw the image of the BSL Dara and oh man
[2020-10-31 14:22:52] <hannahjbg> Can Hank say hi?
[2020-10-31 14:22:59] <communionradio> I didn‚Äôt know the lockdown happened until almost two weeks later! Lol
[2020-10-31 14:23:00] <almot200> Haha
[2020-10-31 14:23:00] <quizlacey> can you get Tracy on as a guest on teh stream, while someone else does the BSL?
[2020-10-31 14:23:02] <cerseilannistersupremacy> WOOHOO
[2020-10-31 14:23:11] <kaipage> @communionradio valid point, try to keep the aggression down though!
[2020-10-31 14:23:11] <kayjupe> @quizlacey second this
[2020-10-31 14:23:15] <ashaschaos> It took a Labour mp asking at pmqs tho
[2020-10-31 14:23:22] <juleanna> Sofie is not impressed with this chat
[2020-10-31 14:23:29] <communionradio> I third Tracy as guest
[2020-10-31 14:23:31] <cazzalarouge> people with a beard and same colour hair all get compared as being alike
[2020-10-31 14:23:35] <thatgirlcan> When the government have interpreters at the briefings they are usually quite good, but they're not on all channels/on the online platforms so it's not easy to watch with BSL
[2020-10-31 14:23:40] <shinnyshinykey> @quizlacey Yes!
[2020-10-31 14:23:40] <cazzalarouge> and all people with glasses look alike apparently

[2020-10-31 14:23:48] <almot200> Dude that dog is a beast
[2020-10-31 14:23:52] <devbear> @kayjupe We managed to get a good mood check on Tracy earlier, she was at a 7. I think if we make them say Holiday she will enjoy herself more :p

[2020-10-31 14:24:29] <charliemilleruk> You get BSL if you watch the briefings on the BBC News channel right?
[2020-10-31 14:24:33] <teacake2000> Adam Hills looks like my boss

[2020-10-31 14:29:43] <mister__cash> hes at about 30 percent compared to the rest of you
[2020-10-31 14:29:46] <rexroof> if mark can hear him okay, must be something between the stream and mark
[2020-10-31 14:29:46] <duncanland1> Answer the 3rd survey for Cerys here: https://forms.gle/MCeqvUNZEQW2BQPL7
[2020-10-31 14:29:46] <franimall> turn off Auto mic settings
[2020-10-31 14:29:47] <juleanna> still very quiet
[2020-10-31 14:29:48] <josierustle> joe needs to sign now
[2020-10-31 14:29:50] <devbear> Joe are you actually 200ft tall and 2 miles away from the microphone?
[2020-10-31 14:29:51] <ashaschaos> Bonnie was awesome
[2020-10-31 14:29:54] <renegadeangel5> Very quiet for me too
[2020-10-31 14:29:55] <quizlacey> @djian1000 anyway, once I had googled him on teh dancefloor during Tricky, I was able to relax and enjoy a fairly private performance of Walk This Way!
[2020-10-31 14:29:57] <communionradio> Guys if you can‚Äôt hear it there‚Äôs always the interpreter ;)
[2020-10-31 14:30:01] <wolfofdroolstreet> Lycett is really quiet, even when shouting
[2020-10-31 14:30:02] <ovedascy> Bonnie hype!!
[2020-10-31 14:30:13] <mrsbottom> I'm still pro a Bonnie-led coup
[2020-10-31 14:30:19] <6502> He's talking into a pumpkin instead of a microphone.
[2020-10-31 14:30:20] <ooojeremycorbyn> can hear him ok tbh
[2020-10-31 14:30:23] <ovedascy> Big hype for Joe's face!
[2020-10-31 14:30:23] <ashaschaos> Social distancing from the mic
[2020-10-31 14:30:23] <sylkensomers> a very nice face
[2020-10-31 14:30:28] <caracompass> where is your mic
[2020-10-31 14:30:29] <turlygod> hullo lovely joe
[2020-10-31 14:30:30] <almot200> HahaBall
[2020-10-31 14:30:32] <mister__cash> THe mic pickup is like its in another room
[2020-10-31 14:30:33] <ashaschaos> Ha ha ha
[2020-10-31 14:30:36] <sophie_jiffy> Joe what mic input is your laptop using
[2020-10-31 14:30:40] <andrewmccafferty> You‚Äôre prob using the internal mic and not your earbuds
[2020-10-31 14:30:42] <ooojeremycorbyn> no, its really me
[2020-10-31 14:30:44] <devbear> @mrsbottom I'm here for The Hag's return
[2020-10-31 14:30:45] <cerseilannistersupremacy> i think the mics on airpods can be a bit shit
[2020-10-31 14:30:45] <thatgirlcan> Haha - exactly!
[2020-10-31 14:30:45] <rexroof> if people on the call can hear him, it's probably an issue with the stream setup relaying his sound
[2020-10-31 14:30:54] <rusty_wingnut> Yes, great to see you Joe, but you sound like you‚Äôre miles away!
[2020-10-31 14:30:57] <zach2504> the mic is in the pumpkin
[2020-10-31 14:30:58] <ali3ghouse> #satire
[2020-10-31 14:30:58] <devbear> No it's me, I'm Jeremy Corbyn.

[2020-10-31 14:31:12] <abuch000> a bit better but still quiet
[2020-10-31 14:31:14] <sophie_jiffy> Joe just check the mic input. It might be the laptop instead of the Airpods

[2020-10-31 16:29:22] <devbear> watto could we get all of our interpreters to feature in the BSL version?
[2020-10-31 16:29:22] <andrewmccafferty> @duncanland1 Coleman‚Äôs on a chickadee
[2020-10-31 16:29:23] <caracompass> be v impressed if paul interprets billy joel
[2020-10-31 16:29:26] <yinzerpincer> lmao

[2020-10-31 16:29:35] <the_humble_one> no it isnt haha
[2020-10-31 16:29:42] <sebastocrator> the sign for fisting is quite obvious. even better than bum
[2020-10-31 16:29:44] <haidiw> caroline put loads of mustard on the swan
[2020-10-31 16:29:49] <kayfor27> Almost as catchy as Dart Behind the Ear!
[2020-10-31 16:29:49] <the_humble_one> fisting paul
[2020-10-31 16:29:53] <tasbo75> Never forget the swan of mustard!
[2020-10-31 16:29:54] <josierustle> that's a very rough way to rub mustard on a swan
[2020-10-31 16:29:57] <emmad1978> no they joined after you mentioned
[2020-10-31 16:29:58] <mzlondon> It's been slightly different from all the interpreters I think
[2020-10-31 16:29:58] <edinburghsnicestboy> I don't believe mustard on a swan is a sex act no
[2020-10-31 16:29:59] <24hrbarney> "GREY POUPON" - Revenge of the Swan!
[2020-10-31 16:30:01] <ashaschaos> Fisting us never out of place tho
[2020-10-31 16:30:01] <pippa555> oh dark behind the ear - memories!!!!
[2020-10-31 16:30:02] <mrhyde_1st> You could possibly do it from your gofund me, maybe a donate over x and get it as a download?
[2020-10-31 16:30:06] <pippa555> dart behind the ear!
[2020-10-31 16:30:12] <glasgow_sheep> One of the signers was quite enthusiastic with the outing of mustard on the swan
[2020-10-31 16:30:15] <hotel2tango> Just say loads of weird stuff now to see what it loks like signed

[2020-10-31 16:30:30] <lydia_m> definitely want it again
[2020-10-31 16:30:30] <larastockley> what if we make a charity video of us all signing mustard on a swan?
[2020-10-31 16:30:31] <rflanagan2000> I liked rainbow marmite condiment song from different show but think visuals might push this ahead
[2020-10-31 16:30:34] <haiminh_> If you play it again, can we have Paul sign it again?
[2020-10-31 16:30:34] <mart__smith> If this doesn't get 10 million Spotify streams then it's a travesty
[2020-10-31 16:30:35] <josierustle> play again!!
[2020-10-31 16:30:35] <pippa555> again! again!

[2020-10-31 16:30:52] <rusty_wingnut> Why someone (eg. Apple Music) selling it to general public for the charities?

[2020-10-31 16:50:07] <someblokefromsomewhere> Such a tricky balance... A person is a person and each is supported -simple. Yet it isn't that simple, because attitudes across the world dictate their own view of normality. To me it's simple, and it's pro. Yet I understand how others may feel otherwise. I refuse to agree though.
