[2020-10-30 21:09:21] <humanhairball> so we are going to put mustard on a swan before the day is out
[2020-10-30 21:09:22] <lachicalolita> "Key's already heavily into the BSL" is not a phrase I expected to hear.
[2020-10-30 21:09:27] <spanners_x> Much love raiders - donation link in the text on the right of the about bit.
[2020-10-30 21:09:30] <murrayhannon> Took me way too long to figure out what BSL means... I'm American. If that's an excuse.
[2020-10-30 21:09:30] <vultmog> @aaron24wood I'm happy to help!
[2020-10-30 21:09:30] <tinytardigrade> ahhaha
[2020-10-30 21:09:31] <eelobrian> by the end Tim Key will be doing the BSL
[2020-10-30 21:09:32] <stevencgr> well no, people can see Tim signing. they can also read the chat, so no need for VSL for visual things.
