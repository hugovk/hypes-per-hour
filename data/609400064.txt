[0:44:39] <corryshawcomedy> Hi Daniel
[0:44:39] <TheRobDeb> @bexturner20 it was one massive one to prove it is indeed a cake.

[0:47:03] <TheRobDeb> @bexturner20 it was pre lockdown....so...yes
[0:47:05] <evilmorwen> Dings are ok as long as there are no dongs!
[0:47:06] <shatnarsbassoon> I'll give (even more) money if you could get Rufus to recreate his Edwina Currie hector meltdown

[0:47:54] <rufusmallet> Surely nothing in this show exists nakedly
[0:47:54] <caitlin_mcaitlin> key obscuring his poster so it says COC
[0:47:57] <algreaves2> football
[0:48:00] <chelseayoung2003> I'm just watching Tim's facial expressions
[0:48:07] <Ponko92> Lancaster canal ain't nothing on the GUC
[0:48:08] <MattCalow> can Dan save and share the map of his running so folks can find him second time round?
[0:48:10] <aSilentMark> @cazzalazarou you’re Caz. Band lady? It’s SilentMark
[0:48:12] <bitparade> nothing is allowed to exist in this stream nakedly, it's against Ts and Cs
[0:48:16] <humanhairball> key determined to make sure coc makes it into this stream somehow
[0:48:18] <ZoeFell> Tim's face is killing me.
[0:48:23] <caracompass> would, for the light, it not make more sense to do one in the morning and one late afternoon tomorrow? or do you need the sleep break
[0:48:26] <serena1975> Angry Mark, 😅
[0:48:37] <mynameismelbert> YES KEY.
[0:48:39] <flopzierabbit> Can you go and check on my narrowboat - it's called Frank! Down near Forton - had to abandon it a few weeks ago
[0:48:43] <katthorne7> If anyone sees me running, something bad is happening and you should be running
[0:48:47] <fakedavidgray> Leave your wallet

[3:14:35] <roddage> when we do the wedding can we say "I know pronounce-off you"
[3:14:36] <httpsterio> I know that but you could amaze Mark and Tim :D
[3:14:37] <hairyandscaryinkorea> I donated a fiver five minutes ago, too late to leave a comment, but I want a pronounce off!

[3:15:23] <Gorilladrummer97> Both myself and my mum donated a few minutes ago but I also want a #pronounceoff
[3:15:23] <flumcake> WHo will judge the pronounce off?

[3:17:48] <cmoorin> I heard Nina was the person that actually crashed Horne's bike.............
[3:17:51] <sam_going> Sofie: high video quality, complementary colours, gorge background, good hair, well-framed shot; Watson: predictably wayward but fair enough, he's hosting; Key: not even certain if he'll be there. Complete question mark
[3:18:01] <Gorilladrummer97> @alexbrewtiful No worries! I hope the total goes up and up 👍

[3:19:52] <ticklemeshelmo> Sophie I’m trying so hard to be fat positive. I’m 50% there and 50% suicidal. It’s a tricky breed being so large
[3:19:59] <tonigunk> I recommend Steve Byrne's documentary on YouTube about The Amazing Johnathan....

[3:20:00] <nabend1402> Andrea Hubert is great. She has a show on NextUp
[3:20:02] <tommayhew> She's very tall
[3:20:02] <wignomore> Key wiping hands on jeans - obv didn't dry properly
[3:20:06] <Gorilladrummer97> @puplock just followed
[3:20:09] <adamlarter> I recommend Ali Brice on NextUp
[3:20:22] <corryshawcomedy> I love Ali Brice ( Hi Larter)
[3:20:27] <sam_going> Watson: "Sometimes drunk; always old"
[3:20:28] <josierustle> ben target's special is great too!
[3:20:29] <httpsterio> @puplock still in need of one?
[3:20:29] <ticklemeshelmo> Sophie I’m trying so hard to be fat positive. I’m 50% there and 50% suicidal. It’s a tricky breed being so large
[3:20:30] <StevenVoiceOver> Mark are they still looking for musicians for the single thingy? and if so when do they record/release it?
[3:20:31] <quizlacey> zoom screenshot achieved...
[3:20:33] <liamgreenjacket> If we're promoting shows-Micheal Legge and Anna Mann both on NextUp

[3:20:37] <josierustle> lot of lancaster talk tonight
[3:20:41] <fatringer> That was the best call back

[3:21:15] <httpsterio> Someone got the Watsonathonatask!
[3:21:15] <cristalcream> I hear that ukulele was ditched mid-marathon a while ago
[3:21:23] <RufusHound> So, when this show is live, drinking feels stupid, because there's so much to do, but I'm literally just sat on my sofa watching TV. Dpoes anyone mind if I'm largely smashed the next time I'm on?
[3:21:24] <Leeky> I never saw live comedy before I went to one of Sofie's new material nights.
[3:21:24] <lachicalolita> Get @turlygod to give Sofie a lesson!
[3:21:37] <ZoeFell> Crack on, Rufus. x
[3:21:38] <noodles4321> robbot2YaDie robbot2YaDie robbot2YaDie robbot2YaDie
[3:21:39] <corryshawcomedy> Get on it Hound x
[3:21:44] <liamgreenjacket> @RufusHound Encouraged if anything
[3:21:47] <monitor360> @rufushound I believe it's encouraged
[3:21:49] <evilmorwen> @RufusHound the drunker you are the funnier it will be for everyone i feel
[3:21:51] <chelseayoung2003> @RufusHound we definitely don't mind
[3:21:51] <RufusHound> No Gayhounds tonight, Corry
[3:21:54] <spiffycakes> Sounds like the Bagpuss theme tune
[3:21:55] <oddGarrett> @RufusHound 👋
[3:21:58] <flumcake> I feel sorry for Sofe's neighbour. Particularly as Tim Fitzhigham lives on the other side.
[3:22:01] <LauraLJS> @rufushound go for it!
[3:22:03] <rflanagan2000> Rufus is gonna be more smashed than those eggs
[3:22:05] <garthmarengidp> Is it bagpuss
[3:22:12] <RufusHound> Right. That's all the encouragement ineed
[3:22:12] <StevenVoiceOver> Mark are they still looking for musicians for the single thingy? and if so when do they record/release it?
[3:22:14] <corryshawcomedy> Get some vodka and have a fancy gayhound mate
[3:22:15] <lachicalolita> @RufusHound We tend to assume you're drunk most of the time.
[3:22:15] <EelOBrian> @RufusHound i'm sure noone watching will mind
[3:22:17] <bitparade> @RufusHound we would be disappointed if you weren't lashed tbh
[3:22:19] <fantayziadesigns> It’s bagpuss isn’t it??!
[3:22:22] <josierustle> do pachelbel canon
[3:22:26] <debbymorgan> @RufusHound you'll be speaking our language
[3:22:26] <King_Rob_UK> Can I go to bed yet?
[3:22:27] <StevenVoiceOver> Mark are they still looking for musicians for the single thingy? and if so when do they record/release it
[3:22:27] <crandizzle> sofie hates the nhs
[3:22:31] <KaiPage> @King_Rob_UK yes
[3:22:34] <welshswanny> @RufusHound can I STRONGLY suggest "Indoor League" on YouTube? You're welcome have fun
[3:22:36] <RufusHound> @lachicalolita Most of the time, this is an excellent hunch
[3:22:36] <KaiPage> @King_Rob_UK I want to see what happens
[3:22:39] <oddGarrett> @King_Rob_UK NO! Who will do all the magic tech?
[3:22:41] <chelseayoung2003> @RufusHound has anyone found anything to cheer you up yet?
[3:22:42] <josierustle> tragedy is technically steps' only wedding-related song
[3:22:46] <tesck> @king_rob_uk sfg8bAhkr3
[3:22:47] <MskieRiot> yes!! @King_Rob_UK and Steve too!
[3:22:50] <aaron24wood> @King_Rob_UK If you do, it's Steve running it.
[3:22:50] <Mart__Smith> sofie on fire
[3:22:50] <biffolot> 🍸 Rufus
[3:22:54] <bitparade> @King_Rob_UK yes, but you must stay awake in bed and still oeprate the cameras

[3:23:14] <RufusHound> @chelseayoung2003 Someone sent me a video on twitter of their kid doing the hokey cokey. That was pretty great
[3:23:17] <EelOBrian> everyone except watson get wasted
[3:23:18] <sky_mia> :D :D :D
[3:23:18] <ZoeFell> At least she's honest.
[3:23:18] <Dr_Electr0> Bring in @Robbotron as well for a Duet in the Ukele
[3:23:19] <ChwareAdre> felt-tip pens ??
[3:23:44] <chelseayoung2003> @RufusHound do you like dogs?? I can send you a video of my dog if you like?
[3:23:45] <JenegadeMaster> Learn C & G, Sofie. Super easy & you’ll get a song out of it!
[3:23:45] <roddage> all of this needs @Robbotron

[3:24:45] <josierustle> øøø
[3:24:46] <kirstynewton> Nick left the room for the anecdote about him. Presumably to help someone else out in the back yard.

[3:25:37] <Clompy_> That was a differemt era for football. Molby, Le Tissier
[3:25:38] <baldie3> Jan Molby has a great danish/scouse accent
[3:25:40] <EdinburghsNicestBoy> Even less of the face now
[3:25:43] <liamgreenjacket> Had his pannini sticker few yrs in a row
[3:25:51] <evilmorwen> are you going to get jan molby on?
[3:25:53] <lachicalolita> Prefer an Andrea Pirlo figure in midfield, personally.

[3:31:13] <PetraPhoenix> I've never trusted Henry Hoover
[3:31:15] <josierustle> what we need is a spooky story-off between the story beast and will seaward
[3:31:15] <anyarob> victory to the henrys
[3:31:20] <gafalkin> What a voice
[3:31:21] <katelilian> how was I unaware of storybeast until now, this is solid gold
[3:31:27] <hazwilliams1> i fear this is a very ill man
[3:31:29] <caitlin_mcaitlin> you mean this ISNT will seaward????
[3:31:29] <Leeky> Story Beast spat water over me at one of Sofie's gigs. That taught me for sitting to close to the front
[3:31:31] <hurricane_ros> @garthmarengidp Eyyyyy! I am the punter Ros rather than boss Ros tho
[3:31:32] <oddGarrett> @cathypenrose you have to accept the storybeast into your life
[3:31:33] <fatringer> This is great
[3:31:36] <bitparade> this is beautifully concerning
[3:31:37] <caitlin_mcaitlin> my mind is blown
[3:31:37] <httpsterio> Would be nice if the guest names was shown on the stream :)
[3:31:42] <histor_crow> @monitor360 indeed, and that works, but some people might not know that's s thing
[3:31:43] <monitor360> story beast is phenomenal
[3:31:46] <MissGroucher> is anybody else not processing the words?
[3:31:47] <alexwilding> PogChamp

[3:36:04] <monitor360> @howlietee about 2 hours ago. ;)
[3:36:08] <aaron24wood> @quizlacey I think it's the quality of Howard's camera.

[3:42:32] <flumcake> The moral of the story? Doh!
[3:42:32] <colinduffin> Sing sing sing
[3:42:35] <monkeyshaver> this tale is the origin of the term d'oh
[3:42:36] <emilyfalkreath> I think the moral of the story is that you will die eventually so just enjoy your life while you've got the chance. so it's good that the dough left home and had some adventures
[3:42:42] <chelseayoung2003> someone actually did the taskmaster task!!!
[3:42:43] <doreenamilne> great. yay
[3:42:46] <liamgreenjacket> @histor_crow someone said lobster earlier, they an be blue
[3:42:49] <aaron24wood> @chelseayoung2003 That's annoying. A refresh usually does the trick...
[3:42:52] <itsmeee111> i thought this was 24 hrs stand up

[4:17:53] <Gorilladrummer97> Love it when Tim leans forward with a hot take
[4:18:22] <markdeeks> that incorrectly completed connect 4 in the background is creating tension
[4:18:24] <chelseayoung2003> I'm loving Key's facial expressions throughout this
[4:18:53] <CazzaLaRouge> only Alex Horne

[4:19:26] <danhawkins20> Anybody know how to make this be on my telly?
[4:19:26] <rflanagan2000> we could do with slight volume boost for key I think
[4:19:48] <roddage> he's loud enough, he's just too far away no?
[4:19:50] <noodles4321> A silent brass system will be the best pando money you can ever spend
[4:19:55] <CazzaLaRouge> Key boost!!
[4:20:03] <KaiPage> @danhawkins20 do you have a chromecast or similar?
[4:20:03] <roddage> they can always use coconuts to diffuse the sound
[4:20:05] <aaron24wood> @danhawkins20 What are you using right now?
[4:20:07] <rflanagan2000> but he is keeping 2m distance from screen
[4:20:08] <chelseayoung2003> Can you turn up Key's volume a bit?
[4:20:12] <mazflaz> nice
[4:20:17] <danhawkins20> App on iPhone mate
[4:20:18] <kateweb2020> @danhawkins20 If you can get the Twitch app on your TV, that's what I'm using

[7:05:07] <oddGarrett> @debbymorgan Very much
[7:05:07] <flumcake> @RambleTash I don't make the rules, I just like taking part in angry mobs.
[7:05:10] <elvesfight> good luck everyone robbot2MrSheeb <3

[7:13:19] <matty_curry> I'm guessing Rhys & Lulu
[7:13:36] <barcelonajames> jordan's being too quiet
[7:13:41] <barcelonajames> suspicious
[7:13:46] <Pokebex> Jordan is v v quiet
[7:13:54] <aaron24wood> @athorist If it was a guess, make it more explicit. Kinda read like a statement
[7:13:54] <puplock> hills is on a STAMP
[7:14:06] <debbymorgan> Jordan is a megastar!!!
[7:14:08] <maunselbarbie> better stats than corona
[7:14:09] <barcelonajames> now making it sound like he doesn't want people to die
[7:14:14] <Pokebex> Yup
[7:14:16] <barcelonajames> i don't buy it
[7:14:22] <josierustle> one death per calendar day
[7:14:40] <hairyandscaryinkorea> 100,000 werewolf deaths by the end of the month!
[7:14:43] <athorist> @aaron24wood I said no spoilers to make it clear that I hadn’t seen any spoilers
[7:14:44] <aaron24wood> In the games I've seen, effort is actually sus
[7:14:44] <flumcake> There's a lot of downsides to Bakersville, but it is very close to a tube station.
[7:14:45] <oddGarrett> @jongracey definitely use the term "calendar day" as much as possible
[7:14:47] <RambleTash> We all know the best way to judge levels of fame is people I personally have heard of and I had heard of Jordan before I heard of anyone else here.
[7:15:04] <theg1ngerv1king> is graph man doing a death chart?
[7:15:13] <matty_curry> 4am catchphrase "we have to kill someone"
[7:15:19] <aaron24wood> LOL
[7:15:24] <EelOBrian> falcor a werewolf??
[7:15:41] <OzMills> RHYS DID NOTHING WRONG
[7:15:41] <puplock> @matty_curry work all the phrases in your vows lmao
[7:15:56] <elvesfight> ed gein made the sut
[7:15:59] <puplock> i have a craft room, can confirm have not murdered
[7:16:00] <recluseinhiding> I welcome death is a bold bluff!
[7:16:01] <OzMills> Rhys is too beautiful to be werewolf!
[7:16:03] <roddage> leave Rhys aloneeee
[7:16:23] <inrbm> how can I send you a picture?
[7:16:25] <20s0methingSara> Quite a lot of serial killers are crafty. I have my suspicions about Kirstie Allsop.
[7:16:25] <hairyandscaryinkorea> Two of them are definitely hairy on the inside!
[7:16:29] <debbymorgan> trying to hard?!
[7:16:43] <crescentmoonrising> According to the Hannibal tv show ALL serial killers are arty
[7:16:46] <corryshawcomedy> Im convinced its Lulu....shes being too quiet PLUS Dotty is too cute to be of this world
[7:16:48] <athorist> @20s0methingsara She murdered those iPads
[7:16:49] <bitparade> @20s0methingSara it's the look in her eues, isn't it?
[7:16:51] <debbymorgan> right colt lets here your backround story please

[7:17:19] <matty_curry> awwwwww RIP Rhys U wiv da Angels now
[7:17:25] <OzMills> baker?
[7:17:27] <evilmorwen> taken too soon
[7:17:28] <maggiefbk> RIP Rhyswolf hype.
[7:17:40] <debbymorgan> SOFIE DID IT
[7:17:42] <martingmcg> Lycantrophy is a disease. This is anti-werewolfism.
[7:17:43] <maunselbarbie> boooooooo
[7:17:45] <tommayhew> IT'S ALWAYS THE WAY
[7:17:48] <debbymorgan> she's too innocent
[7:17:48] <chelseayoung2003> suspense!
[7:17:50] <recluseinhiding> gasp!!!
[7:17:54] <josierustle> *GASP*
[7:17:56] <prvix> Justice for Rhys
[7:17:57] <chelseayoung2003> OH NOOOO
[7:17:58] <athorist> Oh no
[7:18:07] <evilmorwen> what if there is no werewolf and this isa metaphpto
[7:18:13] <rachaelpl> I hope you can live with yourselves.
[7:18:13] <elvesfight> Rhys was the Kirk of Bakersville
[7:18:21] <athorist> I’m sorry Rhys F
[7:18:31] <bitparade> @evilmorwen what if the werewolf was... society?
[7:18:33] <flumcake> What if the real werewolf was the werewolf we made on the way?
[7:18:44] <oddGarrett> @flumcake 🤔
[7:18:54] <oddGarrett> KRANG!
[7:18:59] <humanhairball> Krang died!!!!
[7:18:59] <elvesfight> they did kill the mob leader first thing
[7:19:00] <evilmorwen> what if we are ALL the werewolf
[7:19:01] <josierustle> jordan xD
[7:19:01] <aaron24wood> Thoguht it was Krang
[7:19:04] <aaron24wood> LOL
[7:19:04] <puplock> RIP JORDAN
[7:19:04] <bazABZ> Krang!
[7:19:05] <matty_curry> The real werewolves were the friends we made along the way
[7:19:06] <tommayhew> KRAANG.
[7:19:20] <tommayhew> Kraang is the most famous one here now
[7:19:31] <corryshawcomedy> I'm going Mark and Lulu. Mark looks guilty and too excited to be innocent
[7:19:38] <matty_curry> Lulu defo
[7:19:45] <danhawkins20> I spy Tom Mayhew
[7:19:55] <24hrbarney> Mark's doing his "innocent" face
[7:20:01] <matty_curry> Misdirection from Lulul there
[7:20:03] <tommayhew> Y'alright @danhawkins20 ?
[7:20:08] <megbd> sophie voted!
[7:20:12] <JordanRasko> jordan132Robot jordan132Robot jordan132Robot jordan132Shredder
[7:20:13] <megbd> that's what a killer would say!
[7:20:39] <tommayhew> How did you get a Shredder emoji?!
[7:20:49] <elvesfight> two people can fight with shields alone
[7:20:56] <danhawkins20> Tom, here to do a turn?
[7:20:58] <oddGarrett> @tommayhew it's an emote on her own channel
[7:21:00] <josierustle> high pitch = wereworld
[7:21:05] <martingmcg> Lulu has a small werewolf in bed with her.
[7:21:08] <chelseayoung2003> Rhys looks so upset
[7:21:11] <debbymorgan> still saying sofie is the werewolf
[7:21:18] <inrbm> blessed pandemic
[7:21:18] <corryshawcomedy> 100% Watson. I have no doubt. He is too joyous
[7:21:34] <20s0methingSara> Rhys has a lovely shroud game going on
[7:21:35] <24hrbarney> Is that a socially distanced angry mob?
[7:21:37] <josierustle> the pando is the true werewolf
[7:21:41] <evilmorwen> maybe if they didn't kill werewolves immediately the werewolves wouldn't try to fit people up. maybe this harsh justice system is systematically flawed.
[7:21:48] <chelseayoung2003> I'm living for Jordan's backgrounds
[7:21:48] <corryshawcomedy> Lulu's dog is called Dotty and she is tooooo cute
[7:21:50] <evilmorwen> justice 4 werewolves
[7:21:51] <mynameismelbert> preach
[7:21:53] <puplock> can we not just live in harmony
[7:21:58] <tommayhew> I think Sofie and Lulu.
[7:22:01] <elvesfight> sofie and mark have both said that now
[7:22:02] <recluseinhiding> Not Sofie!!!
[7:22:05] <bazABZ> it's colt and adam then!
[7:22:17] <maunselbarbie> "i'm never the werewolf" is statistically not a strong argument
[7:22:19] <tommayhew> Lulu was standing up for here werewolf buddy...
[7:22:23] <megbd> exactly what a werewolf would say!!!
[7:22:24] <flumcake> "Because I'm not the werewolf". That's exactly what the werewolf would say!
[7:22:25] <crescentmoonrising> Lulu and Sphie at a guess? Lul it too quiet and Sofie is talking a lot
[7:22:26] <corryshawcomedy> Definitely Mark and I'm now swaying between Hills and Lulu
[7:22:30] <recluseinhiding> Lulu??
[7:22:35] <kentishizzie> Dotty often blessed us with their presence at the Pleasance Dome, suuuper fluffy
[7:22:35] <megbd> me think the lady doth protest too much!
[7:22:38] <20s0methingSara> Can attest I’ve never seen Sofie or Mark be a werewolf and they’re both quite sad about this
[7:22:38] <maunselbarbie> Jordan's background game is STRONG
[7:22:40] <josierustle> is seinfeld not copyrighted??
[7:22:40] <martingmcg> "It's maths" - Sofie is one step away from saying "I followed the science"
[7:22:41] <danhawkins20> Haven't seem Tom Mayhew since i nearly vomited Stella in the comedy store, keen for this
[7:22:41] <oddGarrett> "werewolves are killing me legally"
[7:22:45] <r3k5> Okay, but I think Sophie is right. The werewolves would have voted to eliminate Rhys, and Sofie went against both of the other living people who voted for Rhys, meaning both of them have to be werewolves because if she were the werewolf, she wouldn't point out that one of the others is probably a werewolf, thus outing her ally
[7:22:46] <evilmorwen> they know who each other are, right? because they're looking at the screen when they are shown
[7:22:46] <alanbadger> CAFE HYPE
[7:22:49] <corryshawcomedy> Not Sofie, she's too furious to be lying
[7:22:49] <flumcake> (Unless they were in werewolf form, in which case they'd say "bark")
[7:22:50] <24hrbarney> If the jury had half a brain - never heard that on Ally McBeal
[7:22:56] <aaron24wood> ROFL Just noticed the Seinfeld
[7:22:59] <humanhairball> Excellent Background work from ghost Jordan
[7:23:00] <aaron24wood> Excellent work
[7:23:06] <foster_kittens> knowing who the Wolf is makes this si much more fun to watch
[7:23:08] <recluseinhiding> just misunderstood...
[7:23:08] <Pokebex> Yeah it’s not sofie
[7:23:09] <debbymorgan> sofie
[7:23:12] <elvesfight> little rhys in rhy's background?
[7:23:13] <mynameismelbert> sofie and mark?
[7:23:23] <oddGarrett> @evilmorwen they close their eyes at "night" except for the werewolves
[7:23:30] <evilmorwen> @mynameismelbert that's what i think now
[7:23:31] <corryshawcomedy> OK it's Hills and Watson.
[7:23:33] <evilmorwen> @oddGarrett right
[7:23:35] <chelseayoung2003> betrayal!!
[7:23:35] <corryshawcomedy> Convinced
[7:23:41] <mynameismelbert> deffo sofie and mark
[7:23:47] <elvesfight> they literally have the villain beards, not trusting that
[7:23:50] <matty_curry> Colt and Lulu
[7:23:58] <mynameismelbert> hence disbelief at him putting up his hand
[7:24:06] <evilmorwen> also mark has already displayed the supernatural ability to be in two places at once
[7:24:06] <kateweb2020> Colt
[7:24:07] <rachaelpl> I reckon you’re right @corryshawcomedy Also, Hi.
[7:24:25] <megbd> they're taking out all the ausytralians!!!
[7:24:32] <megbd> this is genocide!
[7:24:38] <puplock> NO
[7:24:45] <tommayhew> what!
[7:24:47] <corryshawcomedy> Hey Rachael! I KNOW it's Mark, I know his little face too well. And Hills is a bit too squeaky.
[7:24:56] <puplock> RIP HILLSY
[7:24:59] <elvesfight> here's hoping not 2 deaths tonight
[7:25:09] <maunselbarbie> YAAAAAAAAY

[7:38:24] <chelseayoung2003> I currently have the shakes from the amount of caffeine in my system
[7:38:26] <athorist> @20s0methingsara Why who do you have to ask?
[7:38:53] <mynameismelbert> don't forget to eat!
[7:38:59] <jongracey> In case you've just joined us: We're about to play Werewolf: Live - a bluffing game like mafia - two of them are randomly assigned to be a werewolf and the rest need to kill them before they get munched
[7:39:01] <deano1957> Bladdersville....hype
[7:39:11] <ShiftyMcShift2> "Yeah, Bakersville has been lovely since Mark and Hillsy left"
[7:39:11] <kateweb2020> @chelseayoung2003 Food sometimes helps more than caffeine
[7:39:24] <RambleTash> @20s0methingSara My a level psychology teacher used to just take pee breaks whenever. She'd be gone ages as well. I used to get my lunch out in class while she was gone.
[7:39:26] <elvesfight> town of zombies ahh
[7:39:35] <20s0methingSara> @athorist Unfortunately 6 year olds aren’t trustworthy enough to chill out while I go pee
[7:40:02] <bitparade> @20s0methingSara get a portaloo put in the classroom with the top half of the door removed
[7:40:03] <comicfrankie> What are house prices like in Bakersville?
[7:40:06] <chelseayoung2003> @kateweb2020 I'm also eating doritos, not exactly healthy but at least its something haha
[7:40:19] <josierustle> i almost fell asleep too tbh
[7:40:24] <24hrbarney> Rhys is a mob unto himself
[7:40:24] <RambleTash> @bitparade Horrifying suggestion, thanks.
[7:40:27] <kateweb2020> i'm hoping it's Mark again
[7:40:32] <emmad1978> 👏👏👏👏👏👏
[7:40:39] <bitparade> @RambleTash better than having the bottom half removed
[7:40:41] <20s0methingSara> @comicfrankie Slightly less expensive than Midsomer but more atmospheric
[7:40:51] <maunselbarbie> kill Mark. We have 17 more hours of him
[7:40:57] <kateweb2020> @chelseayoung2003 All snacks are good!
[7:41:10] <roddage> pushers anonymous
[7:41:20] <josierustle> that's called a comments section
[7:41:36] <inrbm> too many Rhys
[7:41:41] <Nightbot> @indoormortalorchestra -> What are you on about? [stop posting links] [warning]
[7:41:46] <strangeyettrue> @20s0methingsara as a parent of a 6 year old you have hero status to me. I’m looking forward to him going back to school so I can pee alone instead of him following me.
[7:41:56] <20s0methingSara> No such thing as too many Rhys
[7:42:10] <KaiPage> indoormortalorchestra: Hi everyone! We desperately need LOTS of singers for our charity single in aid of Mark's chosen charities! Anyone who can hold a tune, basically. Miles Jupp & Kevin Eldon recorded vocals for the song this evening. Can anyone help us out with spreading the word on Twitter? You can find us here: http://www.twitter.com/indoormortals - Thank you
[7:42:10] <aaron24wood> http://www.twitter.com/indoormortals
[7:42:21] <kateweb2020> protesting too much, Eatson
[7:42:22] <megbd> hes reaching....
[7:42:22] <danhawkins20> do people prefer pistachio nuts pre-shelled or do we like to remove the shells ourselves?
[7:42:24] <loonybinreject> cant be as many deaths as the villages of midsummer
[7:42:26] <20s0methingSara> @strangeyettrue Haha thank you 😂
[7:42:29] <inrbm> absolute dungeon
[7:42:31] <aaron24wood> @KaiPage Yeah, should have done it in a oner
[7:42:34] <athorist> It’s definitely Mark, I didn’t look
[7:42:34] <ShiftyMcShift2> Same old story: Everyone loves Animal Crossing until that animal is a werewolf. Can't get a break.
[7:42:38] <IndoorMortalOrchestra> Thank you Kaipage!
[7:43:20] <bazABZ> Rhys is very two faced. Well, five faced.
[7:43:28] <loonybinreject> @danhawkins20 in shells.
[7:43:44] <elvesfight> long live Rhys!
[7:43:46] <flumcake> Rhys can't be the werewolf. He'd rather die than deal with the hair removal regime that would be required.
[7:43:48] <gemmac3> I kept my eyes open this time, it’s so funny knowing who it is and knowing the other contestants don’t know 😂😂 #nospoilers
[7:44:11] <puplock> @gemmac3 i dd that last round, it's so good
[7:44:25] <molpheus3000> but you were in love actually
[7:44:26] <bazABZ> same, i always keep my eyes open for the 2nd game
[7:44:37] <inrbm> too many cooks
[7:44:37] <20s0methingSara> I’m struggling to tell which Rhys is the real Rhys
[7:44:42] <gemmac3> Last round I played by the rules and made a cuppa during the night phase 😂😂
[7:44:58] <athorist> @20s0methingsara If they hang the fake Rhys he’s fine
[7:44:59] <RambleTash> RudolphWhoa RudolphWhoa RudolphWhoa RudolphWhoa
[7:45:00] <bitparade> @20s0methingSara does *anybody* know the real Rhys? Really?
[7:45:07] <puplock> SHOTS FIRED
[7:45:09] <recluseinhiding> it's Watson again isn't it... so indignant...
[7:45:12] <danhawkins20> loonybinreject agreed, even better when we could throw the shells on the pub floor
[7:45:21] <cubeisclown> Oft Sofie

[7:45:46] <josierustle> the fact that i can't see mark's mouth atm looks dodgy
[7:45:56] <deano1957> Hercule Hills LUL
[7:46:04] <athorist> Werewolves never start the attack they pile on
[7:46:07] <aaron24wood> The way Colt's face lit up...
[7:46:07] <comicfrankie> Watson doesn't drink his drink. That's got to be more suspicious...
[7:46:09] <Nightbot> @mynameismelbert -> I can do this all day... [stop spamming caps] [warning]
[7:46:18] <20s0methingSara> Drinking weird is only a sign you’re a murderer if you’re drinking blood. Or Chianti
[7:46:24] <loonybinreject> Mark looks like neighbour Wilson from home impo
[7:46:30] <ZoeFell> No but seriously, who was lulu?
[7:46:33] <gaxwq> What a desperate plea! I call werewolf

[7:48:23] <joehistrying> @ZoeFell emma thompson's daughter
[7:48:29] <20s0methingSara> I think it might be Sofie.
[7:48:36] <20s0methingSara> She scares me

[7:53:16] <thetedhill> #justice4sofie
[7:53:19] <sofiehagencomedian> Can I speak to the manager
[7:53:31] <inrbm> Karen?
[7:53:32] <evilmorwen> ok karen
[7:53:35] <puplock> you just did sofie, it didn't go well
[7:53:47] <sofiehagencomedian> I WAS SET UP
[7:53:53] <OzMills> WOW
[7:53:54] <comicfrankie> Not the sort of thing you should say Mark...
[7:54:03] <20s0methingSara> East London doesn’t get birds. I can hear police cars though. Lovely lovely police cars.
[7:54:04] <evilmorwen> if it's mark again i will die laughing
[7:54:28] <loonybinreject> @sofiehagencomedian at least you can nap now?
[7:54:30] <danhawkins20> Hills has the virus
[7:54:45] <gaxwq> Very nice elbow cough
[7:55:02] <MattCalow> sounds like one of my housemates is waking up... wonder how confused they'll be by all this
[7:55:16] <danhawkins20> You didn't kill him though Adam
[7:55:20] <deano1957> JR is clearly a vampire not a werewolf.... MaxLOL MaxLOL
[7:55:21] <Nightbot> @bitparade -> Boop! [stop spamming caps] [warning]
[7:55:40] <comicfrankie> Can werewolves get the covo?
[7:55:42] <20s0methingSara> Rhys looks like a peacock with a tail made of his own face...
[7:56:07] <cubeisclown> Oh my gee @20s0methingsara yes!
[7:56:32] <bitparade> @ysrmahmood did an all-caps
[7:56:40] <evilmorwen> i am predicting my housemate won't wake until 11am
[7:57:08] <mynameismelbert> my human housemate has gone to bed just now, and the furry one has woken up and thinks it's time for breakfast :/
[7:57:11] <ysrmahmood> did you get to excited lol @bitparade
[7:57:20] <ShiftyMcShift2> There are wolves in these here Hills.
[7:57:25] <24hrbarney> 2 in 7
[7:57:42] <roddage> it'd be 4/49 for two consec games
[7:57:42] <evilmorwen> @mynameismelbert classic peepers!
[7:57:56] <24hrbarney> so about 1 in 10
[7:58:09] <inrbm> BEEF
[7:58:11] <roddage> yeah, not outrageous odds
[7:58:14] <cubeisclown> Haha, Rhys!!!
[7:58:17] <OzMills> Now birds are singing outside
[7:58:19] <niamhneve9> Oh god why go for the person the DEAD werewolf nominated
[7:58:27] <athorist> @roddage It’s still 2/7, because it’s 2 given that he was already a werewolf once
[7:58:29] <h2osarah> There is definitely light in the sky and birdsong in hammersmith
[7:58:33] <megbd> she speaks sense
[7:58:47] <megbd> ohhhhhhh
[7:58:53] <h2osarah> cannot believe I've made it through the darkness. Really thought I would be able NOT to sleep
[7:58:54] <evilmorwen> (i used to live with melbert's cat in case anyone is wondering.)
[7:58:56] <20s0methingSara> Jordan is being quiet. TOO quiet 🧐 suspicious
[7:59:02] <roddage> if you use conditional probability I agree, I was just remarking on the general probability of it happening twice. @athorist
[7:59:07] <maunselbarbie> yeah but everyone is pretty white
[7:59:13] <BobertyRob> two things: what is the welfare of the pup? and can we do this til noon?
[7:59:15] <thetedhill> i agree with @ahtorist on the probability point
[7:59:26] <aaron24wood> Yeah, I have bird song too
[7:59:34] <TheAmcorr> Birds are a'tweeting outside
[7:59:56] <deano1957> LP is too cute to kill <3
[8:00:08] <josierustle> very violent deaths happening here
[8:00:13] <puplock> #savehillsy
[8:00:17] <crescentmoonrising> I don't have birds but that might be due to the local cat population
[8:00:32] <chelseayoung2003> bye mark
[8:00:57] <bitparade> Surely the chances is 2/7 as 100% of all first games nominate someone, so you can ignore all probabilities
[8:01:02] <niamhneve9> I just have my cat snoring
[8:01:03] <comicfrankie> Is Rhys mistaking Hills for an African Tree Frog?
[8:01:12] <puplock> #JUSTICEFORHILLSY
[8:01:15] <loonybinreject> poor adam
[8:01:31] <ZoeFell> So. Much. Birdsong.
[8:01:53] <athorist> It’s Mskie I feel sorry for
[8:02:01] <evilmorwen> @bitparade don't bring maths into this,it's too early/late
[8:02:16] <puplock> @athorist i'm chatting to her now, she's feeling a bit rotten
[8:02:16] <20s0methingSara> Poor Rhys
[8:02:26] <20s0methingSara> Shroud hype
[8:03:03] <bitparade> No, it's 2/13 now I think about it
[8:03:03] <flumcake> Justice should either be done correctly, or adhering to an arbitrary deadline
[8:03:07] <mynameismelbert> trouser hype!
[8:03:11] <ShiftyMcShift2> Ah, the old "I wear pants" defence.
[8:03:13] <comicfrankie> They'd rather die than let Mark live. Gotta respect that.
[8:03:25] <TheAmcorr> #trouseguy
[8:03:38] <bazABZ> does anyone ever convince the 2 people who nominated them to not then kill them?
[8:03:40] <ysrmahmood> How long is this game
[8:03:43] <TheAmcorr> #pancakeguy
[8:03:44] <aaron24wood> Pancakes before trousers
[8:03:46] <Pokebex> Trouser hype
[8:03:47] <KaiPage> !donate
[8:03:47] <BobertyRob> trouserless pancakes sounds like a risky business
[8:03:47] <Nightbot> http://donate.watsonathon.com
[8:03:51] <maunselbarbie> Still a good mood on death row
[8:03:54] <josierustle> pancake & trousers hype!
[8:03:56] <rachaelpl> I would love a pancake.
[8:03:56] <KaiPage> Donate to the man in trousers!
[8:03:59] <roddage> haha, it's 2/7 for any game, 2^n/7^n for n games.
[8:04:05] <loonybinreject> normal would depend on where you put the trousers
[8:04:05] <24hrbarney> risky business has a trouserless moment
[8:04:06] <athorist> @bazabz Should be able to convince one of them
[8:04:11] <emersonyoung> Is it really so normal to put trousers on at the moment though?
[8:04:12] <flumcake> It's all very well to claim you're wearing trousers when there's a camera that's only showing from the neck up.
[8:04:12] <TheAmcorr> lol
[8:04:12] <grace_fla> Pancakes first.
[8:04:14] <matty_curry> Mark Watso's just a guy who puts trousers on
[8:04:28] <puplock> maybe mark has no trousers on now
[8:04:29] <TheAmcorr> #trousersfirst
[8:04:33] <puplock> maybe none of them do
[8:04:36] <loonybinreject> if you put your arms in them, not the most typical but you do you
[8:04:36] <puplock> just saying
[8:04:44] <evilmorwen> who amongst us can say that we have never or indeed always worn trousers?
[8:04:47] <magnificentjosh> I make some trousers, put some pancakes on
[8:04:55] <maunselbarbie> Rhys has big haunted spirit energy
[8:04:59] <athorist> I think it’s Jordan
[8:05:04] <magnificentjosh> Jordan for sure
[8:05:21] <bitparade> @magnificentjosh ...and think about leaving the house?
[8:05:24] <Pokebex> It’s gotta be Jordan
[8:05:30] <howlieTee> How is it nearly 5?
[8:05:32] <loonybinreject> rhys looks very much like witches from macbeth

[8:15:28] <ubiquitykilljoy> It's only just after midnight here. My fussy old neighbours are going to be so confused by music this late

[8:22:04] <Gorilladrummer97> I've been tempted to start watching in bed but that is a risky game. Still in the living room right now

[9:33:21] <comicfrankie> Short for relationship, I think...
[9:33:41] <sam_going> Why do I now want a photo of Mark's dad

[9:35:00] <prvix> That was impressively sinister
[9:35:01] <splashinginthestream> I need to see what Mark's dad looks like
[9:35:02] <chelseayoung2003> I'm terrified
[9:35:03] <rflanagan2000> More volume in lous hair than on keys webcam

[9:35:44] <chelseayoung2003> Look at Mark's twitter, certain there was one recently
[9:35:44] <KaiPage> LUL
[9:35:51] <DJChizzles> chicken and badgers LUL
[9:35:51] <Kirwinia> chocolate and biscuits, naturally.
[9:35:57] <chelseayoung2003> or maybe his insta
[9:36:16] <mynameismelbert> t and a?
[9:36:21] <comicfrankie> 'Family friendly'
[9:36:24] <Kirwinia> Feminism *fistpumps*
[9:36:26] <sam_going> Baps out once again
[9:36:26] <splashinginthestream> why is she talking about Mark's mother's ****?
[9:36:39] <TheAmcorr> ti.. ti ...
[9:36:47] <mynameismelbert> because she was also takling about his dad's c and b
[9:36:47] <chelseayoung2003> Look back to the 29th March on Marks Twitter, there a pic of his dad!
[9:36:51] <MattCalow> pretty certain Twitch would kill the stream at that point.... worth the risk ;)
[9:36:53] <sam_going> Panny D NotLikeThis
[9:36:59] <josierustle> like a maccy d?
[9:37:12] <Kirwinia> Nono, Lou, don't worry.
[9:37:15] <Kirwinia> We're strapped in.
[9:37:17] <phyphor> We call them "le baps"
[9:37:28] <evilmorwen> i mean i was about to back away but that is a very good point
[9:37:36] <KaiPage> LUL
[9:37:52] <sam_going> Lou did you pass Jill to Katherine Ryan? If so how did that happen?
[9:38:06] <chelseayoung2003> as far as we know so far, 16 is the youngest person watching, so you're fine
[9:38:14] <crescentmoonrising> If we don't try then we will lose the fight
[9:38:23] <tombeard99z> You have been awesome over this period mark also loving the book i picked out from you being so generous
[9:38:37] <KaiPage> @chelseayoung2003 people might have it on with their kids around, not necessarily specifically watching!
[9:38:40] <sam_going> HOW MANY people is Jill servicing??
[9:38:43] <Kirwinia> We're feeling pretty divine and feminine right now, but that could be this chocolate milk we're drinking, and the milkshake we have coming.
[9:38:47] <josierustle> jill hype!!
[9:38:55] <chelseayoung2003> @KaiPage ah, very true!

[9:39:35] <evilmorwen> also not everyone will be participating in the chat
[9:39:46] <sam_going> I would love a DMT experience
[9:40:00] <Kirwinia> Dimethyltyptamine?
[9:40:07] <sam_going> Forget Jill, get me some DMT...
[9:40:10] <Kirwinia> Er. Dimethyltryptamine even.
[9:40:19] <athorist> Kids ask your shaman to help you
[9:40:48] <TheAmcorr> Me too!
[9:40:48] <Kirwinia> Remember: Spiritual experiences should only happen under the guidance of a trained professional.

[9:48:46] <Kirwinia> Hey Becca!
[9:48:49] <danathemanstan> whoops! subjbect matter was about drugs tho :)
[9:48:55] <anastasia_beaverhausen> how's it been?
[9:48:56] <puplock> what makes it worse is that i moved out of my parents two weeks before lockdown, so it's the first time i've ever lived on my own
[9:49:09] <puplock> and i don't have her here to help
[9:49:17] <aaron24wood> @puplock Ouch...
[9:49:18] <puplock> it's so hard, not going to lie
[9:49:18] <funnelly> i need to be on that show

[9:49:32] <rossvanderh> @puplock I'm really sorry, that sucks
[9:49:40] <evilmorwen> i'm so sorry @puplock, that sounds rough.
[9:49:41] <KaiPage> I can get that through
[9:49:54] <puplock> thanks all
[9:49:55] <comicfrankie> The moderators can ignore the blocked phrases, I think
[9:50:02] <KaiPage> What was it again?
[9:50:08] <cubeisclown> That’s proper adulting hard mode @puplock . I’m sorry to hear that!
[9:50:13] <chelseayoung2003> ahaha thank Lou!
[9:50:15] <puplock> finding it hard but i'm getting through it with the lovely people here

[9:50:52] <jrobbins996> I doubt I’m nice but I definitely need a guy Lou lol
[9:50:54] <Kirwinia> You have plenty of women, but are they straight, bi, or pansexual women? Are they cisgender or transgender? There's so many variables, Lou!
[9:51:06] <humanhairball> That bloke is 34...
[9:51:10] <splashinginthestream> I'm laughing at the comment of 'being a bit short' (of nice guys)

[9:56:00] <TheAmcorr> #flipitover

[9:56:21] <magnificentjosh> I am hyped for us all to eat yoghurt as one beautiful mouth

[10:09:35] <Lunarsaurus> some of the hours fly by
[10:09:43] <katy_pickle> Had a few hrs sleep. Where’s Key and why’s mark dressed as a rabbit?
[10:09:45] <chelseayoung2003> 10 hours straight, no naps!
[10:09:47] <24hrbarney> we'VE TIMED IT IN THE PAST...
[10:09:49] <a_rob_world_class> 10hrs in and the countdown is nailed for the first time
[10:09:50] <katelilian> I took a disco nap but never fully fell asleep!
[10:09:50] <magnificentjosh> Shall we do a synchronised yoghurt eat for hte next hour?
[10:09:52] <bazABZ> i thought i might manage 2 or 3 hours. Still here!
[10:09:59] <i_in_the_dark> I'm still awake - just

[10:10:46] <LauraLJS> Also back from a couple of hours sleep and working out what’s happened
[10:10:48] <sam_going> I once went to a Key gig and he'd forgotten he'd asked everyone to prepare. Unreliable
[10:10:48] <crescentmoonrising> Still going, though I do keep on zoning out every few minutes
[10:10:58] <24hrbarney> Boss fight with a goat!
[10:10:59] <glasgow_sheep> I can’t take that praise I’ve just woken up again. Good morning mark, what# have I missed
[10:11:00] <theg1ngerv1king> still going but eyes are dropping,kettles on for coffee

[10:15:23] <josierustle> #havingashocker
[10:15:32] <splashinginthestream> This book sounds like it would put women off trying to get to know men better
[10:15:44] <DJChizzles> shelley_louisep not quite the same as watching live, but it'll all be up in the VOD section after the show finishes at 9pm!

[10:17:06] <josierustle> just having a chat, that's what it's all about!
[10:17:17] <aaron24wood> @flumcake The annoying thing is that while I can delete other messages, can't delete my own spelling errors.

[10:22:10] <aislinndraws> fun fact about joops: i worked on his show at the fringe once, and he was so delightful to a fan afterwards that she got really flustered and left her signed book behind. when he saw her in the queue for the next day's show (she'd come to buy a replacement book) and he took the original out of his bag to return it to her, she nearly lost her mind she was so overwhelmed. it was a nice little thing to witness!
[10:22:13] <splashinginthestream> That shirt probably goes over well at the Fine Arts dept around campus
[10:22:14] <glasgow_sheep> Where in fife are you

[10:32:05] <puplock> <3 <3 <3 <3
[10:32:06] <mrcomedytech> seeing Phill always makes me yearn for backstage oysters at The Stand!
[10:32:22] <splashinginthestream> Comedy club I am familiar with will open soon at 50% capacity, people sitting spaced out
[10:32:25] <puplock> my mood has been LIFTED
[10:32:30] <aaron24wood> ROFL
[10:32:39] <puplock> thanks joops <3
[10:32:43] <josierustle> i'd love for comedy gigs to be more like the final gig of the fringe in vibes
[10:32:46] <splashinginthestream> spaced out literally, not because of illegal substances
[10:32:53] <evilmorwen> i miss gigs
[10:32:56] <howlieTee> People wanna hide
[10:33:00] <jrobbins996> I’m that guy lol
[10:33:04] <sam_elliotts_tache> I've always wanted space myself.
[10:33:13] <Queen_liz_uk> I work in theatre and this is ALL TRUE!!
[10:33:18] <sam_elliotts_tache> always book an aisle
[10:33:20] <aaron24wood> Hi Liz
[10:33:29] <howlieTee> So very true
[10:33:30] <aaron24wood> And yes, it's true
[10:33:36] <jrobbins996> My favourite gig last year was Russell Kane where I had an entire row to myself
[10:33:37] <davsk> Ah cool the queen is here
[10:33:37] <josierustle> live comedy gigs are so great and i'm sad i can'te experience it :(
[10:33:38] <nealp> Happy to sit at the front on my own.
[10:33:43] <katelilian> I'm going to go to so many gigs once the pando is over
[10:33:50] <davsk> Haha @jrobbins996
[10:33:57] <howlieTee> Hello @nealp
[10:34:04] <elvesfight> there's somewhere to watch that performance again?
[10:34:05] <flumcake> Pando Panto
[10:34:12] <nealp> @howlieTee Morning.
[10:34:15] <puplock> miss you joops <3 x
[10:34:17] <danathemanstan> russel kane was brilliant - even though he took the p*** out of me near the front
[10:34:24] <MattCalow> @flumcake sounds great to me
[10:34:29] <alfajones> 150 people have woken up
[10:34:34] <24hrbarney> Cam-a-ra-der-ie, wasn't that a song?
[10:34:41] <DJChizzles> puplock I nearly deleted that for the spelling error LUL
[10:34:44] <bazABZ> so many comedy gigs i had tickets for were cancelled or pushed back. Can't wait to see live comedy again.
[10:34:48] <prvix> Good morning new people!
[10:34:52] <puplock> @DJChizzles you should have lmao
[10:34:59] <Kirwinia> @Queen_liz_uk How's it going?
[10:35:00] <howlieTee> Anyone else who’s been up all night suffering from the cold yet?
[10:35:10] <KaiPage> @puplock all of the mods hesitated over it haha
[10:35:10] <flumcake> @MattCalow - "He's two metres behind you!", etc, etc.
[10:35:27] <puplock> @KaiPage you should have saved me the typo embarrassment!!
[10:35:31] <katelilian> @howlietee been wearing a blanket as a cape
[10:35:38] <KaiPage> @puplock we know for next time! :D
[10:35:39] <rowsietheriveting> You're doing such a good job, Mark.
[10:35:39] <Kirwinia> ...:/
[10:35:41] <puplock> love to joops please <3 <3 <3 <3
[10:35:52] <howlieTee> Great choice @katelilian! I’ve got a hot water bottle and a cat
[10:35:53] <Kirwinia> Oof.
[10:36:06] <katelilian> @howlietee lucky!
[10:36:09] <cubeisclown> No @howlietee not cold.. currently lying at the foot of my bed in the sun like a cat.
[10:36:14] <kateweb2020> Hype to the tech team, making all this possible!
[10:36:14] <katelilian> this has been really nice
[10:36:29] <solobinary> mooooorning VirtualHug Squid1Squid2Squid3Squid4
[10:36:42] <splashinginthestream> Is that true? Would it make a difference if the performer already could feel confident that their efforts would, for sure be appreciated and enjoyed . .
[10:37:02] <splashinginthestream> even if they were delivered in a different format
[10:37:03] <katelilian> this is the closest to a festival atmosphere of the online gigs I've watched so far
[10:37:06] <athorist> Tech team hype!
[10:37:16] <katelilian> hype techs!
[10:37:17] <tonigunk> I miss live comedy ...
[10:37:18] <anastasia_beaverhausen> AHKR
[10:37:25] <humanhairball> tech hype
[10:37:25] <puplock> joops hype <3
[10:37:29] <sam_elliotts_tache> tom stades whole show nowadays is a conversation with the audience
[10:37:32] <evilmorwen> we've had long enough in the chat to start to get to know each other
[10:37:33] <kateweb2020> It's the feedback, I think; not being ablw to see/hear a reaction
[10:37:34] <nealp> @splashinginthestream Definitely; they want the feedback.
[10:37:41] <rowsietheriveting> Tech hype!
[10:37:48] <evilmorwen> if you go to a thing for an hour or two that's not really long enough
[10:37:50] <howlieTee> God I miss theatres
[10:37:53] <evilmorwen> but 24 hours yeah!
[10:38:11] <davsk> So true about audiences wanting to have a good time
[10:38:13] <evilmorwen> (online i mean, real life bonding is quicker)
[10:38:18] <splashinginthestream> I'm enjoying this discussion most among all that has been offered. This is interesting.
[10:38:23] <rflanagan2000> Really enjoying the comedic insight from these two
[10:38:27] <humanhairball> loving the ebb and flow of this show, It works really well
[10:38:27] <24hrbarney> this is nice - it's pretty laid back.
[10:38:31] <tonigunk> I was at one of Mark's show and he warmed up with his laptop and talking about the crowd....
[10:38:36] <chelseayoung2003> Loving this conversation!
[10:38:37] <ZoeFell> It's nice to just switch off from the Pando for a bit.
[10:38:38] <alastairedmonds> I caught a fish!
[10:38:38] <kirstza> I miss that moment just before a show starts, when the audience just goes quiet with anticipation. gives ne goosebumps
[10:38:41] <DJChizzles> back soon - play nice, chat!
[10:38:44] <puplock> can we get joops to join in the cuddle pile in chat
[10:38:46] <davsk> Fun for dayz
[10:38:47] <josierustle> i don't understand why you'd go to a comedy gig if you didn't wanna have a good time??
[10:38:52] <Ledavi> One advantages of the lockdown is I can watch top comedians live from my bed without needing to actually move
[10:39:00] <puplock> best bear <3
[10:39:06] <flumcake> The long shows are a thorough investigation into how true the "leave them wanting more" cliche is
[10:39:09] <aaron24wood> @josierustle Oh, that happens. Many fringes have taught me this...
[10:39:09] <davsk> @josierustle some people are idiots
[10:39:20] <Kirwinia> Trying to restore our chill now, trying to focus on the fun story.
[10:39:26] <chelseayoung2003> Steve's back!
[10:39:27] <sam_going> Do you get annoyed by people coming up to you after shows?
[10:39:30] <nealp> Had too many arguments with hecklers as a punter.
[10:39:34] <anastasia_beaverhausen> hi steve
[10:39:38] <kateweb2020> @josierustle You see people who do, though; sit through it, arms folded
[10:39:40] <howlieTee> The best heckle put down I’ve ever heard is “this is a scripted show and you haven’t got any lines”
[10:39:41] <katelilian> on that bombshell!
[10:39:41] <chelseayoung2003> Watch out Phil, Steve's gonna boot you off screen
[10:39:46] <24hrbarney> I try to see Burns on a Friday or Saturday, to see him rip apart hecklers
[10:39:51] <davsk> Haha chimps so true
[10:40:01] <Gorilladrummer97> That was a lovely chat
[10:40:02] <kirstza> @kateweb2020 such a waste of time and money!
[10:40:09] <splashinginthestream> I don't consider myself a 'heckler' but I do engage with performers in a small comedy club
[10:40:10] <theg1ngerv1king> are self gigs are better than club spots? easier to play to a crowd that have paid JUST for you,than a crowd who may have come for someone else on the bill?
[10:40:13] <davsk> That was a great insight
[10:40:15] <aaron24wood> @24hrbarney Oh yeah. A master
[10:40:22] <josierustle> oh i know people do it – i've had so many gigs where audience have ruined the gig for me because they were in a foul mood and wouldn't let themselves leave
[10:40:24] <kateweb2020> @kirstza Absolutely
[10:40:27] <sam_going> Deffo up for a comedy Q&A
[10:40:33] <nealp> engage when asked, otherwise shut up.
[10:40:33] <elvesfight> can this bit be clipped and put on your twitter? @WatsonComedy
[10:40:40] <splashinginthestream> I am sitting in the front row, right in front of them. I enjoy speaking to them. I talk with them because I want to share a laugh with them, or something they have said makes me feel curious.
[10:40:45] <puplock> joops hype please <3 <3 <3 <3
[10:40:45] <davsk> Yep @nealp
[10:41:02] <solobinary> hype hype hype stupid longshows EarthDay VirtualHug VirtualHug VirtualHug
[10:41:08] <splashinginthestream> It's about connection/engagement with me. Trying to give back a degree of the humour they are gifting me with. I love it when we are both laughing.
[10:41:13] <aaron24wood> All hail the free festivals!
[10:41:13] <kateweb2020> @zimmer91 I think in some ways yes, but then you're solely responsible
[10:41:25] <ZoeFell> <3
[10:41:34] <josierustle> whenever i see bob slayer at the fringe it's very much full of wonderers, but he's great at making it part of the fun

[10:41:51] <rflanagan2000> daylight playing hell with Watsons lighting
[10:41:53] <hvdijk> Remember one guy at Frankie Boyle's show who heckled, in an annoying way that annoyed others, not because he was showing off to his friends but out of love for Frankie, he really thought he was doing a good thing
[10:41:53] <joehistrying> oh mach <3

[11:15:23] <fakedavidgray> @aaron24wood @anastasia_beaverhausen you two have far too much stamina if you've been here all night.
[11:15:24] <flumcake> The classic confusion
[11:15:25] <comicfrankie> Huh. Enter button on this keyboard is where the delete should be.
[11:15:38] <DJChizzles> fakedavidgray morning!

[11:15:47] <anastasia_beaverhausen> @fakedavidgray I have kids, iv been asleep as I need to parent 🤣
[11:16:05] <fakedavidgray> Surely that's what Kieran is for :D
[11:16:05] <DJChizzles> I had a couple of hours sleep as I'm working whilst doing this madness LUL
[11:16:21] <tonigunk> I had a couple hours too....
[11:16:29] <mynameismelbert> pep us up!
[11:16:32] <anastasia_beaverhausen> @fakedavidgray he's asleep too
[11:16:37] <Kirwinia> We were lurking for all the early bits but we've been here and will be here until it ends. No need for sleep.
[11:16:53] <theg1ngerv1king> been here since 9pm. in too deep to stop now
[11:16:53] <anastasia_beaverhausen> @fakedavidgray plus I didn't sleep the night before
[11:16:57] <tonigunk> needed to get my head down... I had my earphones plugged in though
[11:16:57] <mynameismelbert> definitely funky
[11:17:02] <chelseayoung2003> funky bunch hypeee
[11:17:03] <24hrbarney> we probably smell funky
[11:17:05] <TheAmcorr> i am funky
[11:17:09] <cubeisclown> We’re plenty funky
[11:17:10] <josierustle> i feel funky!
[11:17:10] <guddjuni> we're Hella funky!
[11:17:10] <corryshawcomedy> Hey lifers, how you all holding up? Remembering to hydrate and eat bananas?
[11:17:18] <splashinginthestream> Considering how long people have been sitting here, not brushing their teeth, probably 'funky bunch' is fitting
[11:17:18] <johnk2k> wait, are we not called the funky bunch?
[11:17:43] <howlieTee> Got to be honest I’m struggling a bit here, gonna have a banana
[11:17:46] <h2osarah> @corryshawcomedy I can take my phone to the toilet, so I'm absolutely caning water.
[11:17:52] <thetedhill> Mood update pls
[11:17:56] <DJChizzles> I think we might be the Pando Maniacs
[11:17:56] <24hrbarney> Much easier to eat, drink and change pants at home Corry
[11:17:58] <josierustle> i've been drinking quite a good bit of water, now i'm eating cereal
[11:18:11] <corryshawcomedy> It certainly is Barney!
[11:18:18] <cubeisclown> oh gawd, i just realised i’ve been awake for 24 hours... i didn’t plan this well
[11:18:25] <howlieTee> Sudden fond memories of Brendon Burns checking how we smelt
[11:18:27] <guddjuni> you can clean teeth, why not? watch on your phone
[11:18:47] <andysmart79> you're not saying you are Wahlberg, that is for others to say
[11:18:52] <flumcake> That sounds like a marketing slogan. "Homes: A place to eat, drink and change your pants"
[11:19:10] <splashinginthestream> he is definitely separate from them
[11:19:22] <splashinginthestream> He's the front man/leader of the funkiness
[11:19:25] <Gorilladrummer97> Same @kate_bishop - the next half won't be easy
[11:19:48] <Kirwinia> It's OKAY!
[11:19:51] <howlieTee> What is “sleep”?
[11:19:55] <Kirwinia> We don't even know the definition of the word sleep
[11:20:04] <chelseayoung2003> What's sleep?
[11:20:09] <MattCalow> i have lost track of what is going on
[11:20:14] <puplock> what a loser
[11:20:30] <puplock> that's mental
[11:20:48] <andysmart79> Wahlberg was funny in Ted, but not in Ted 2
[11:20:49] <puplock> lmao :D :D
[11:20:53] <splashinginthestream> Doesn't he have regularly scheduled meals of cooked egg whites too
[11:21:05] <splashinginthestream> His regimen is rather fascinating
[11:21:07] <adamlarter> transformers is the best comedy series ever
[11:21:16] <ZoeFell> We can be Watson's Funky Bunch.
[11:21:17] <teacake2000> He has more time for God than his family?!?!
[11:21:37] <howlieTee> Lazenby!
[11:21:42] <cubeisclown> @gorilladrummer97 we can do it! 🙌 (but aw boy)
[11:21:49] <MattCalow> nah @ZoeFell; we're Watsonian's United and always will be
[11:21:57] <chelseayoung2003> I'll tweet him now
[11:21:57] <mrchuckles2002> where are the bakers?
[11:22:03] <ZoeFell> @MattCalow Good point.
[11:22:05] <MattCalow> oh yeah, Lazenby!
[11:22:10] <splashinginthestream> We all love you and consider you 'funky' enough to join their bunch, Mark
[11:22:17] <flumcake> Check his schedule and see when he's available. Can't interupt his time pretending to be an ice-cream.
[11:22:17] <sky_mia> hahaha
[11:22:24] <MattCalow> or any Bond for that matter
[11:22:44] <rflanagan2000> Braff was standoffish but we turned him
[11:22:46] <josierustle> LATE in the day??
[11:22:50] <chelseayoung2003> Mark Whalberg isn't on twitter :(
[11:22:59] <chelseayoung2003> MAJOR FLEX
[11:23:03] <RufusHound> Wahlbergathon doesn't work
[11:23:10] <katelilian> real talk
[11:23:17] <howlieTee> We got Walsh we can get Whalberg
[11:23:19] <mynameismelbert> get him via hi sbrother
[11:23:20] <MattCalow> Braff would not be a good call today though, after the news from the Scrubs cast yesterday
[11:23:20] <RufusHound> as a phrase, I mean
[11:23:40] <sky_mia> @mattcalow What was the scrubs news??
[11:23:45] <Kirwinia> Gotta get you a nice 1080p/60fps camera!
[11:23:46] <anastasia_beaverhausen> @mattcalow r.i.p ted 😢
[11:23:47] <meinsslaymaker> Hey @24hrbarney . Should've known you'd be here! Hope you're ok fella! Chris says hi too.

[11:24:17] <cubeisclown> I’d like ‘poorly’ as cool slang
[11:24:18] <josierustle> i mean 'well' can be used as an intensifier
[11:24:25] <sky_mia> not my fave pando
[11:24:29] <josierustle> like "that's well great"
[11:24:36] <thetedhill> MARK HOW IS YOUR MOOD

[11:36:35] <howlieTee> That must’ve been about the time we bought in a crash barrier claiming it was a gate

[13:28:22] <KaiPage> None of us could believe how up for it all Gillian was
[13:28:23] <RingroadKarl> Sitting in a stench of souring whipped cream was horrific. In a bear suit.
[13:28:23] <meesterjd> Oh a drink of water. Get that down TedHill
[13:28:29] <annawaits> just looked up to see Horne on TV and got thoroughly confused. he's on Saturday Kitchen Live

[13:30:34] <ZoeFell> THERAPY HYPE
[13:30:48] <38geese> We appreciate what you're trying to do!
[13:30:48] <caitlin_mcaitlin> THERAPY HYPE
[13:30:58] <chelseayoung2003> How can i tell my therapist that crone a put a curse on me??
[13:31:12] <charlotte_sones> Tho still charging for an hour
[13:31:17] <wolfofdroolstreet> Everything is better with Rufus, Celebrity Juice is proof of that ❤️
[13:31:18] <MattCalow> Therapy hype!
[13:31:27] <howlieTee> You don’t get a cuppa from an nhs therapist I feel deprived
[13:31:32] <howlieTee> I do get tissues though
[13:31:37] <Leeky> Therapist tea is still cheaper than train tea
[13:31:43] <hotrats65> Im a therapist and don’t offer a cup of tea
[13:31:46] <chelseayoung2003> tea hypeeeeeeee
[13:31:48] <turlygod> he runs #acms? tell edinburgh audiences...
[13:31:49] <MattCalow> I was told to bring a sports drink with me to my sessions. very necesary for the kind of therapy I was having
[13:31:56] <biffolot> Judging the therapists
[13:32:02] <raeofthebooks> tea? we dont have that to offer in the nhs! we barely have rooms or tissues
[13:32:19] <hotrats65> lol true about the tissues
[13:32:24] <cathypenrose> MattCalow PT by any chance lol
[13:32:25] <lightofdavid81> haha a flask to therapy, ohh my theraspist is making better points now this is relaxing
[13:32:28] <BethanyLL> rehydration
[13:32:30] <caitlin_mcaitlin> therapy needs electrolytes
[13:32:33] <mynameismelbert> we got a cold water point and some tissues....
[13:32:35] <KaiPage> It can be done
[13:32:37] <raeofthebooks> @hotrats65 😅
[13:32:44] <MattCalow> no, REM sleep style stuff. properly exhausting
[13:32:46] <RambleTash> I can do titanic amounts of crying in an hour
[13:32:47] <puplock> my therapist argued with me about the condition i'd already been diagnosed with lmao
[13:32:49] <franimall> @turlygod we know the truth
[13:32:54] <alexisbeanquiff> do we have the bakers
[13:32:55] <Leeky> Is this why I yawn during a good therapy sesh?
[13:32:56] <katelilian> do we have the bakers?
[13:33:00] <EdinburghsNicestBoy> I once had someone play some drive-by Shakira during my counselling session, and it changed the tone
[13:33:03] <turlygod> do we have the bakers?
[13:33:04] <cathypenrose> oh sleep therapy
[13:33:11] <MattCalow> EMDR therapy sorry
[13:33:17] <josierustle> i'd love me some therapy right now
[13:33:22] <franimall> are the bakers due
[13:33:24] <cathypenrose> turlygod happy face
[13:33:31] <Leeky> This is sleep deprivation therapy
[13:33:31] <lightofdavid81> haha
[13:33:32] <mynameismelbert> eye movement desensitisation something
[13:33:33] <alexisbeanquiff> do we have the bakers
[13:33:36] <MattCalow> Eye movement Desensitisation and reprocessing.
[13:33:36] <ameliealthaus> @leeky Good idea, when I'm back give me an update?
[13:33:38] <teacake2000> Is this not therapy?
[13:33:42] <rowsietheriveting> EMDR is great for anxiety, Mark!
[13:33:44] <catfishhenry> i used to make iced lattes for my physiotherapist since i got him up so early
[13:33:46] <crescentmoonrising> Group Scema therapy did have a water fountain but nothing else
[13:33:46] <Geertzilla> surely an energy drink would detract from the actual sleeping?
[13:33:51] <ricozorilla> Horne a lot more confused with this Saturday Kitchen format than Watsonathon. Bring him home
[13:33:52] <cubeisclown> @turlygod HELLO!
[13:33:55] <raeofthebooks> Maybe we can put on a reflective practice group as part of the after party 🤦🏻♀️
[13:34:00] <crescentmoonrising> Then again, it was also free
[13:34:02] <MattCalow> essentially replicating REM sleep whilst conscious to alter mind state. It was very helpful for me
[13:34:03] <solobinary> balint
[13:34:04] <catfishhenry> if you have caffiene at certain times of your sleep cycle can make you drowsier
[13:34:06] <josierustle> i literally was thinking of applying for therapy before this pandemic started and i had a stable income, bad timing on my part!
[13:34:08] <Nightbot> @alfiedoodle -> What an interesting hypothesis. [stop posting links] [warning]
[13:34:15] <chelseayoung2003> I don't know if i can tell my therapist that I was put under a curse by a crone
[13:34:26] <DJChizzles> USEFUL LINK: Angel Comedy have a list of therapists and some are offering reduced rates during the crisis: https://www.angelcomedy.co.uk/therapy/
[13:34:30] <RambleTash> My therapist refused to keep seeing me.

[13:35:14] <aaron24wood> @RambleTash OK, now THAT is the most RambleTash thing I've ever seen you write
[13:35:16] <alfiedoodle> I linked to Angel Comedy's therapy page - they have collated a list of people offering therapy, many of which have reduced rates during the crisis
[13:35:21] <BethanyLL> looking up about EMDR
[13:35:25] <alfiedoodle> I was not being naugty!
[13:35:28] <glasgow_sheep> Why is nightbot not in bed

[14:01:09] <ZoeFell> Yes! <3
[14:01:15] <johnk2k> Awesome news about Faye!
[14:01:15] <caitlin_mcaitlin> PPOSSIBLE STEPS HYPE
[14:01:24] <turlygod> tozer hype
[14:01:24] <RambleTash> @evenibzy Apart from when I nodded off briefly with my phone on my face and my headphones still on, no.
[14:01:35] <cathypenrose> Surely false?
[14:01:38] <Evenibzy> @rambletash go to bed! 😆
[14:01:47] <Geertzilla> TRUUUUUEEEEE
[14:01:50] <flumcake> Wait a minute though, if I remember the Tragedy video correctly, doesn't the members of Steps turning up at your wedding signify a, well, tragedy?
[14:01:55] <DrewBear84> Yes!!! ❤️ Faye
[14:01:59] <glasgow_sheep> I miss mark
[14:01:59] <Geertzilla> FAAAAAALLLLSSSEEE
[14:02:10] <groggibear> ghostcar
[14:02:12] <RambleTash> @evenibzy But then who would be hyped about everything? :O
[14:02:26] <annawaits> I'm going for "I think it's true but I think it's stupid" again
[14:02:34] <Evenibzy> 🥳🥳🥳
[14:02:36] <cathypenrose> glasgow_sheep do you think he's gone for a sneaky sleep the lightweight lol
[14:02:41] <katelilian> true
[14:02:44] <franimall> true
[14:02:46] <ARICHCOMICLIFE> true
[14:02:46] <MONKeEeYboi> TRUE
[14:02:51] <howlieTee> True
[14:02:52] <franimall> stunt men use them
[14:02:53] <DrewBear84> @flumcake nooooo... it would be amazing and everything! Tragedy is not my favourite track of theirs though...
[14:02:56] <josierustle> true!
[14:02:57] <howlieTee> It’s how they do testing and stunts
[14:03:07] <glasgow_sheep> @cathypenrose more likely a big poo
[14:03:22] <franimall> exactly
[14:03:29] <24hrbarney> marks off for more interviews

[14:03:53] <glasgow_sheep> @cathypenrose pleasure
[14:04:23] <cathypenrose> SpadgersHat do they have any more Bonds? They should ask Daniel Craig he seems like he's up for a laugh
[14:04:57] <SpadgersHat> @cathypenrose Yeah there's loads of bonds actually. I'll get a BCC email going
[14:05:01] <glasgow_sheep> I want more sausage cannon
[14:05:06] <erry_stevenson> hi Mark
[14:05:10] <roblukeperrin> l once jumped a red to prove a point that there is a safety zone where you are free to cross. I got 3 points but we didn't die so I was right.
[14:05:11] <guddjuni> yay, Mark
[14:05:13] <flumcake> @DrewBear84 I remember it as them turning up and splitting up the happy couple, but I may be confusing that with a Renault Clio advert.
[14:05:15] <franimall> hey Mark
[14:05:27] <josierustle> mark's back!
[14:05:31] <GarethCoop> oh hai mark

[14:58:08] <howlieTee> Hello @stevepretty
[14:58:13] <wolfofdroolstreet> How much would we need to donate to choose your zoom background for the ceremony? Warning, it will probably be completely inappropriate

[15:12:41] <cathypenrose> Could we get Matt Lucas on to sing the Baked Potato song. I could DM him on Twitter
[15:12:45] <comicfrankie> You did a speech at Mark's wedding, right? Just copy that. No one will notice
[15:12:46] <mrbrewerman2> if you got Minchin and Key to collaborate imagine the song/poem!!!

[15:37:20] <wignomore> Can we get a different Bond instead?
[15:37:39] <zoesmum2020> Is anyone else not listening to this and just focussing on the cute agent? 😂

[15:39:12] <RambleTash> This is the first time this show has made perfect sense.

[15:39:30] <Weaselspoon> You're watching Comedy Club 4 Kids https://twitter.com/ComedyClub4Kids

[15:39:50] <cristalcream> trousers!
[15:39:50] <trunkmanproduk> I've just popped by to see how you're all doing and this is the exact level of madness I was expecting.
[15:39:55] <mrbrewerman2> haha the guy who looks about 12 moaning he's getting old. no hope for me then
[15:40:01] <chelseayoung2003> This is so weird but i absolutely love it

[15:40:56] <girlsamwhyte> Lovely doggy.
[15:40:57] <roddage> Just came back from leaving at 6am, I know we didn't get Lazenby, but I think Roger Moore is on the Chiswick Roundabout.
[15:41:03] <NextUpComedy> Mark's had enough ;)
[15:41:03] <zoesmum2020> Agent agreed with her client then. 😂
[15:41:08] <johnt652> CorgiDerp puppy CorgiDerp
[15:41:14] <cathypenrose> Actually ON the Chiswick Roundabout lol
[15:41:16] <chelseayoung2003> Bye Mark
[15:41:21] <Mart__Smith> Am I hallucinating? or is it just the alcohol?
[15:41:23] <johnk2k> this reminds me of when zig and zag used to go rogue
[15:41:34] <katelilian> Sean Connery was the best bond though
[15:41:35] <howlieTee> Oh I remember zig and zag’
[15:41:46] <ienjoybiscuits> <3 <3 <3
[15:41:51] <anastasia_beaverhausen> I never had this with Otis the aardvark
[15:41:55] <ysubcharity> I reckon we could get Dalton
[15:41:58] <zoesmum2020> Where’s our leader gone?
[15:42:08] <biffolot> Aw Otis
[15:42:10] <cubeisclown> I loved Otis!
[15:42:12] <roddage> @katelilian I have to say I'm firmly in the Roger camp
[15:42:14] <cygnusalpha> THsi is ace!
[15:42:24] <chelseayoung2003> Where's Mark!?
[15:42:25] <ZoeFell> Can we get Flicky Herman for the end of the show?
[15:42:25] <bristoldamo> They sound like Adam Buxton's Cilla Black impersonation...
[15:42:47] <recluseinhiding> Education at its best!
[15:42:47] <Leeky> @DTichborne They so do!
[15:42:50] <OfficialCDJ> Oucho, you have a lovely Fidas shrine!
[15:42:52] <Zhadnost> Is it just me or does that puppet sound like Adam Buxton?
[15:42:54] <MarkGrimshaw> I'm amazed to find out the Oucho language is actually written and planned.
[15:42:55] <glasgow_sheep> @dtichborne they so do 😝
[15:42:58] <jrobbins996> I had a crush on Barney Harwood as a kid and Ed to be fair
[15:43:01] <comicfrankie> Is he using a Welsh accent?
[15:43:05] <kgorman620> Lorra lorra blinda date

[15:43:26] <lunik1> @DTichborne can't unhear it now
[15:43:28] <comicfrankie> A kids tv reunion
[15:43:29] <caracompass> lockdown has done strange things to oucho
[15:43:30] <aaron24wood> Right... THAT is now the most @RambleTash thing I've ever read.

[15:43:34] <maribiscuits> I had planned to get lots of work done today, but this is much more enjoyable.

[15:45:07] <hopefulfutility> What's 'baker' in oucho language?
[15:45:08] <katherinestar1> @glasgow_sheep they're kids tv presenters from when i was a kid (aka like 10 years ago) and this is like Oucho's language - "Cactinian"
[15:45:10] <OfficialCDJ> Long story...look for the #OOTBC podcast coz Iain explains it! @alexisbeanquiff
[15:45:10] <MskieRiot> <3 @Ali3GHouse
[15:45:11] <Ali3GHouse> THIS IS THE BEST TIME

[15:46:01] <OfficialCDJ> 'Out of the Broom Cupboard' - my podcast. Ed (and Oucho) have been guests!
[15:46:01] <shinnyshinykey> @tonigunk Agreed
[15:46:03] <glasgow_sheep> @pinkalotk explains a lot about folk in their teens/20s
[15:46:04] <zoesmum2020> I’ve been watching this for ten mins now and I still don’t know what’s going on. Still class comedy though!
[15:46:06] <turlygod> #agenthype

[15:46:29] <howlieTee> This is taking me back to my A levels
[15:46:30] <hopefulfutility> I hope that while Mark's doing his interview they cut to the live feed in the middle of this and show this mayhem going on.

[15:46:36] <Mart__Smith> i haven't a clue in this dazed state
[15:46:37] <lachicalolita> It's good to have an agent who will throw her toys out the pram during negotiations. Great tactic.
[15:46:39] <CarlRicko> Mark and Steve have lost control of the mad house
[15:46:42] <turlygod> @kaipage her books are full apparently.

[15:58:21] <TechNikky> furiously googling who Oucho is so I can watch more videos when this is done. my Australian upbringing needed more Oucho
[15:58:23] <SpadgersHat> OMG so glad I just returned. ED!
[15:58:23] <colin1984> Never realised how much Oucho sounds like Adam Buxton (and looks like?)
[15:58:27] <SpadgersHat> OUCHO!
[15:58:36] <nealp> @fmz_gaming His name is Tiernan.
[15:58:39] <Nanonic> oucho has a masterful eyebrow
[15:58:48] <glasgow_sheep> oucho is Adam Buxton
[15:58:49] <markdeeks> On a note of unnecessary brevity, it's personally been a very tough pando, and I'm sorry I couldn't put in a proper shift to help here. Also couldn't donate the full £1.2 million as I would ideally have liked to. But while I could be no help to the show beyond making absolutely no headway with George Lazenby, the show has helped me and my pando. Thank you everyone, especially Mark.
[15:58:57] <RambleTash> Oucho should love weddings. He was engaged three times throughout his run on CBBC.

[17:48:27] <sky_mia> do another 24!!
[17:48:29] <rflanagan2000> Have returned to twitch. Had to restart computer as couldn't escape the Watson zoom disco. Luckily, watching show on another computer
[17:48:30] <josierustle> your 27 hour show was the peak
[17:48:38] <chelseayoung2003> I still don't know what this is, but i love it
[17:48:41] <comicfrankie> 48 hours! John Robertson did it
[17:48:46] <howlieTee> 27 was a weirdly optimal number of hours I feel
[17:48:48] <wolfofdroolstreet> How much to go for 48hrs?
[17:48:59] <aaron24wood> 1.2 million
[17:49:03] <chelseayoung2003> move your phone to the left, we cant see
[17:49:11] <katelilian> 👍
[17:49:12] <mynameismelbert> nice day out!
[17:49:12] <comicfrankie> I think the optimal way would be starting at 9am and going 36 hours.
[17:49:15] <fake_selena_gray> flapjack hype
[17:49:15] <chelseayoung2003> there
[17:49:15] <siddhartha5665> what arewe talking about

[17:49:23] <mouldydc27> there!
[17:49:27] <flumcake> The 36 hour show was, with hindsight, probably a little too long
[17:49:33] <evilmorwen> don't see why you couldn't do a week

[17:50:05] <chelseayoung2003> does Dan want to do my Duke of Edinburgh expedition for me?
[17:50:07] <comicfrankie> A week would be, if I'm being honest, maybe slightly too long.
[17:50:09] <katelilian> woo!
[17:50:11] <mutthunt> it takes weeks of training to do this

[19:14:53] <flumcake> #TeethingProblems
[19:14:53] <mattywin85> Who Said That?
[19:14:54] <naomi_aubergine> The boys are too loud, can't hear the women speak
[19:14:59] <fatringer> deborah is very quiet and muffled
[19:15:01] <betrandooh> we can hear everyone
[19:15:01] <dandive> @markgrimshaw watch meet the richardsons on UK TV. Play it's brilliant, you get a tour of the pub!
[19:15:02] <chelseayoung2003> Ive got tickets for Jon in September, praying they dont get cancelled!
[19:15:03] <Crkokinda> Seems like Deb can't hear theo thers
[19:15:06] <h2osarah> no, this has gone weird
[19:15:08] <roddage> just like any panel show @naomi_aubergine
[19:15:09] <ChemicalElephants> This is like a weird version of celebrity squares
[19:15:11] <biffolot> More tech difficulties please :)

[19:15:17] <chez_ali> We can see & hear everyone but Deborah is quite quiet
[19:15:19] <ForbodenOden> 2 women on stream - the boys put on football shirts and start talking over them - doom and gloom
[19:15:22] <RambleTash> I'm very confused.
[19:15:23] <caracompass> had to toast the wedding!
[19:15:29] <tesck> Maaaaaaarrrkkkkkk
[19:15:35] <fatringer> got to wait for Cocktail hour!
[19:15:37] <mattywin85> Do we just have to guess who said the most audible word?
[19:15:38] <KaiPage> Deborah just being spoken over by a load of men here
[19:15:40] <tesck> We can hear all of you at once
[19:15:41] <lucyorchardcomedy> @ForbodenOden that's hilarious

[19:15:55] <RambleTash> I'm going to go and grab some food and water, hopefully nothing insane happens before I get back.
[19:15:56] <Dr_Electr0> I think she is talking in anotehr chat window
[19:15:57] <KaiPage> I don't think they can hear Deb
[19:16:00] <httpsterio> Deb and Laura are still on

[19:25:32] <glasgow_sheep> can we have tiernan and some chilli while we're waiting
[19:25:33] <discoagogogoch> We're just used to not seeing enough women, so we're on edge about it. Mark has a better track record with this stuff than most, but I guess that means we end up expecting more now? I dunno

[19:31:38] <DJChizzles> but we want you lot to set them a good example!
[19:32:00] <borislovechild> Haha lost causes I’m afraid @Dj
[19:32:16] <Leeky> The only way to stop the stream swears would be a delay, and that wouldn't make the show feel so interactive <3

[19:41:21] <comicfrankie> Body blows to Jon and Mark
[19:41:45] <scott2310bennett> best hour of the show so far
[19:41:54] <comicfrankie> Mark knows a lot of words. He is a writer...
[19:42:01] <Zhadnost> To be fair, so did everyone else.
[19:42:20] <eddycmartin> I’m gonna watch all the other episodes of this straight after, such a good format
[19:42:22] <Ali3GHouse> The Deborah Paradox
[19:42:22] <josierustle> i feel like olfactory is a pretty common word people know, like a common smart word
[19:42:27] <lachicalolita> Jon has a smug little face through all this. I say him.
[19:42:35] <kdizzle104> Really love this format - great work guys!
[19:42:36] <prvix> 🐙🐙🐙
[19:42:36] <comicfrankie> Mark might be a werewolf too. He is sneaky...

[19:42:42] <roddage> this is like Werewolf all over again
[19:42:49] <Ali3GHouse> He does like to waffle @lachicalolita

[19:43:28] <adamlarter> first the chicken, then go back for the grain
[19:43:39] <tim_606> wow werewolf feels like a long time ago. The start of that was the last time I gave any serious consideration to going to bed for a while
[19:43:42] <comicfrankie> Over 12 hours ago, I think it started at 4am
[19:43:50] <evilmorwen> werewolf /was/ a long time ago
[19:43:53] <adamlarter> Not had any chat about Turnips for ages
[19:43:56] <alfajones> £27,025!
[19:44:01] <mynameismelbert> there is no time
[19:44:04] <adamlarter> any good turnip rates on the Stork exchange?
[19:44:22] <comicfrankie> Jon there with a self-burn
[19:44:23] <evilmorwen> i think 4am occured during the first game of werewolf and the second one ended maybe just before 5 or slightly after
[19:44:43] <victionicious> hello mark, sent any cheeky texts recently?

[19:44:52] <thetedhill> MOOD update
[19:44:53] <cubeisclown> @evilmorwen feels like it was weeks ago
[19:45:05] <lachicalolita> Roman Empire or Roman? Because you could just turn up dressed as Francesco Totti.
[19:45:12] <howlieTee> 3/3 again

[19:45:32] <glasgow_sheep> 3/3
[19:45:38] <evilmorwen> @kate_bishop the strange timelessness of the long show and the strange timelessness of the pando have combined.
[19:45:38] <adamlarter> Turnip update
[19:45:44] <adamlarter> Turnip Hype!!
[19:45:58] <lachicalolita> So Jon is turning a party into a therapy session?

[19:46:20] <adamlarter> f
[19:46:26] <ForbodenOden> i think coco channel would suit Jon
[19:46:37] <RambleTash> I'm back! I have food! Did I miss much?
[19:46:43] <josierustle> of course jon doesn't have birthday parties
[19:46:47] <comicfrankie> Maybe a special turnip round of the quiz?
[19:46:47] <SpadgersHat> Mainly Jesus
[19:46:55] <aaron24wood> @RambleTash Setting this up and then a couple of rounds.
[19:47:03] <adamlarter> very good point @comicfrankie
[19:47:04] <bitparade> There's something oddly wholesome about that Christmas bit tbh
[19:47:05] <evegasse> Richardson is so relatable.
[19:47:14] <GarethCoop> I'm with Jon there
[19:47:18] <AsFriendsRust> Leeds arent fancy
[19:47:20] <adamlarter> people really want to hear about Turnips. Lets make that graph very interesting
[19:47:25] <wanderboyo> I’m with Jon on that too
[19:47:26] <thetedhill> that'll make me workr really ahrd as i was banking on my turnip graph being basically done without any more mentions
[19:47:28] <adamlarter> I CANNOT remember the last time i ate turnips
[19:47:40] <comicfrankie> Then it's your fault for mentioning it
[19:47:45] <adamlarter> I am going to push for Turnip mentions SO HARD in the last few hours
[19:47:53] <jcarter01422> 3 people who live in Hebden Bridge on one stream?! Now THAT'S a good stream
[19:48:00] <mynameismelbert> TURNIP?
[19:48:02] <howlieTee> Not sure how I feel about getting these right
[19:48:07] <adamlarter> #NeverForgetTurnips
[19:48:13] <MattCalow> Anyone else noticing that we haven't had any overarching themes/group mania like we have before? I mean, there is still time, but unlikely at this point to really take hold

[19:48:41] <biffolot> Force ?
[19:48:42] <emmad1978> @nightbot was it my math? Always been terrible.
[19:48:43] <Seanyspotpig> thing you most need during a pando: back, sack and crack.... uhmmm...
[19:48:43] <hazwilliams1> the word 'force' slightly undermined the caveat haha

[19:49:34] <aaron24wood> @emmad1978 It was the emotes it pulled you up for by the looks of it. Keep it to 2 or 3 and you should be fine
[19:49:34] <ForbodenOden> lol
[19:49:37] <adamlarter> not getting much Turnip work done here tbh
[19:49:38] <rflanagan2000> Reminder-Watson's build-up to this hour was that we'd be starting it with structure after some movements between shows. Happy we are there now and this is good but shame about those 20 fiddly mins at start of hour
[19:49:41] <glasgow_sheep> quite happy myself thanks
[19:49:41] <Nanonic> laura_lexx your face :D
[19:49:42] <thetedhill> so far there have been 19 mentions of turnips if ayone wants to know
[19:49:44] <MattCalow> @crescentmoonrising maybe also because there's more people, so everything is more diluted?
[19:49:46] <PlebeianRob> I’m missing the hell out of our cleaner.
[19:49:53] <ForbodenOden> swoosh-swoosh - swoosh-swoosh

[19:54:42] <PlumbRoberta> !uptime
[19:54:47] <martingmcg> tasty pigeons
[19:54:50] <SpadgersHat> Train one pigeon to be a pigeon wrangler
[19:54:50] <katelilian> does not sleeping make you more competitive/better of winning games?
[19:54:59] <lachicalolita> Pigeons picked tiles off my roof and caused a leak. Damn them.
[19:55:03] <katelilian> because huge if true
[19:55:06] <Mart__Smith> Just playing the game
[19:55:10] <scott2310bennett> shout out for Simon
[19:55:11] <betrandooh> it wasn't a lie, I just phrased it in a misleading way
[19:55:22] <rainbowziggy> Surely it's all about winning?
[19:55:23] <AsFriendsRust> i assumed the whole idea was to mislead
[19:55:33] <thetedhill> yeah the point is to mislead
[19:55:38] <SpadgersHat> Mislead as much as you can lads
[19:55:39] <crescentmoonrising> I feel tell the truth, but phrase it how you like
[19:55:42] <thetedhill> in each possible avenue
[19:56:01] <yorkiepaul> Laura has such a nice smile. Sorry, just saying!
[19:56:28] <comicfrankie> She was saying that Mark is an alpha beta.
[19:56:41] <PlumbRoberta> You should play Cards Against Humanity!

[20:00:16] <h2osarah> the crucial thing we're all missing is that Jon and Lucy are in love with their handyman
[20:00:22] <DeerJaneDoe> @scott2310bennett - I hope so, such a fantastic format.
[20:00:38] <scott2310bennett> @deerjanedoe Preach
[20:00:44] <eddycmartin> @deerjanedoe it’s so good isn’t it, I’d binge watch the hell out of this

[20:02:16] <katelilian> yes I agree with @glasgow_sheep
[20:02:18] <DeerJaneDoe> (Mine would be attempting TikTok dances. An absolutely mortifying sight.)
[20:02:25] <fishsticks1981> Good news. Key's linguistic skills are my Pando hope
[20:02:27] <stewtlee> can you knock points off to take richardson into minus ?
[20:02:30] <chelseayoung2003> poor Jon
[20:02:36] <MattCalow> @h2osarah of course they are... sleepy brain thought you meant DFW for no sensible reason!
[20:02:47] <cathrose> Deborah jazz dancing, Laura armpit, Mark yoghurt
[20:02:48] <chelseayoung2003> Do all the panellists know about the hype thing?
[20:02:57] <howlieTee> Mine is a toss up between the things I say to my cats or the smell checks you do on clothes to see if they can be worn again
[20:02:58] <h2osarah> @MattCalow Fair enough.

[20:07:13] <OldGreggIsMySpiritAnimal> Maybe the game can be tweaked for Covid 20 lol
[20:07:20] <grace_fla> No one wants to see that.
[20:07:22] <flumcake> All the technical issues at the start of the hour were clearly deliberately designed to make sure we had a clean finish before cocktail hour
[20:07:27] <PlumbRoberta> Ahhh. I was in my bed at that point lol. Thank you Kate

[20:13:45] <martingmcg> Does a can of Diet Coke and a handful of Munchies count as a cocktail
[20:13:48] <stuartdeco> Jack knows Leggo
[20:13:51] <DeerJaneDoe> Should invent a special cocktail for the occasion. Shake together espresso, Red Bull and yoghurt. Call it The Wired Watson.
[20:14:01] <caitlin_mcaitlin> beautiful
[20:14:02] <purrsuede1990> I'm getting to the point I'm not sure what I'm going to do after this stream is finished. It's quite nice living life by arbitrary hourly themes. (Mead Martini coming up)
[20:14:12] <naomi_aubergine> @martingmcg absolutely yes
[20:14:17] <httpsterio> Mark do you like coffee?

[20:14:37] <chelseayoung2003> RASPBERRY QUARANTINI'S - Pink gin, pink lemonade Lucozade and raspberry sorbet all blended together
[20:14:40] <comicfrankie> There's going to be an extra hour somewhere. Adam Kay paid for it already
[20:14:46] <emmad1978> @nightbot 👏👏👏👏👏
[20:14:47] <martingmcg> @naomi_aubergine woohoo
[20:14:49] <ForbodenOden> Wang Wang and Funi love the stream
[20:14:53] <raeofthebooks> Does Pepsi Max Cherry count as a cocktail? The small person is still too awake for actual alcohol
[20:14:55] <katelilian> I have ale and lemonade so can make a slightly disappointing shandy if that counts?
[20:14:57] <hannahlangers> @chelseayoung2003 YUM!

[20:15:45] <emmad1978> I'm figuring out the rules, 5 claps seem allowed🤔
[20:15:53] <Kirwinia> God, we wish we could have a drink.
[20:15:58] <wignomore> *gives Jon the Leeds salute*
[20:15:59] <hannahlangers> I’m actually sober, as I’ve got a 7 week old, but with you in spirit

[20:17:13] <howlieTee> I’ve invented a cocktail for cocktail hour
[20:17:26] <humanhairball> mood check
[20:17:30] <caracompass> @howlietee what is!
[20:17:30] <barcelonajames> i really want chocolate
[20:17:31] <thetedhill> mood pre panel show and post?
[20:17:34] <chelseayoung2003> We still think youre GREAT
[20:17:35] <kateweb2020> @battleandbrew I suspect Steve spends a lot of his life in that chair
[20:17:36] <ForbodenOden> miss-rep
[20:17:38] <naomi_aubergine> Excellent hour
[20:17:38] <Geertzilla> wakeness check?
[20:17:39] <mynameismelbert> yeah, caps will get you a time out if you keep doing it.
[20:17:45] <bitparade> @BattleandBrew it's very interesting to see different levels of preparedness for this
[20:17:45] <MattCalow> @howlieTee what's the recipe?
[20:17:56] <Geertzilla> wokeness check, even?
[20:17:57] <naomi_aubergine> This is absolutely flying by
[20:17:57] <chez_ali> Steve have you been up for the full 20hrs so far also?
[20:17:57] <vmlinuz789> After 20 hours, you can get introspective!
[20:17:57] <BattleAndBrew> @kate_bishop He's a pro gamer lol
[20:17:59] <mrbrewerman2> been for an hour's walk. What did I miss?
[20:18:00] <PlumbRoberta> I only did it once. Odd
[20:18:03] <cubeisclown> Started the stream drinking rum and coke... seems like i’ll be ending it the same way! And. Not. Sleeping.
[20:18:04] <purrsuede1990> gonna have a cocktail and a chaser called the Watson And On And On
[20:18:06] <howlieTee> Orange vodka, bitters, bourbon and aperetivo topped up with ginger beer And some lime
[20:18:12] <kateweb2020> Also, it was men getting married - likely to be a more male event
[20:18:12] <emmad1978> I've ordered a take away. Opened a cidre. 🥂
[20:18:13] <caitlin_mcaitlin> get izzie on!!
[20:18:22] <howlieTee> I call it a Long Show
[20:18:22] <probablylucy> Hey I went away but I'm back and I've had an espresso martini and I'm READY ☕☕☕
[20:18:24] <h2osarah> Pizza's in the oven!!
[20:18:29] <chelseayoung2003> I'm still praying Danny Bhoy will turn up at some point
[20:18:29] <BattleAndBrew> @bitparade I watch Steve semi-regularly so I know his setup is really really good.
[20:18:35] <MattCalow> @howlieTee interesting. Does it have a name?
[20:18:43] <24hrbarney> Just "the hard bits are when you're concious."
[20:18:44] <MattCalow> it does lol
[20:18:44] <barcelonajames> ironic that you're supposed to be 'woke' when you're incredibly tired and very much awake for too long
[20:18:45] <caracompass> I wouldn't worry at all about specific segments being male/white/etc orientated. The show as a 24 hour whole, it's good to keep aware of, but the wedding just worked out that way and it was perfect
[20:18:47] <Ali3GHouse> @chez_ali Steve, Mark, King Rob (and possibly Kirsty behind the scenes) have all been up the whole time!
[20:18:50] <wignomore> You and all of your guests have been great. Ignore the haters. You're doing a *fantastic* job
[20:18:51] <MattCalow> long show, I like the sound of it
[20:18:52] <franimall> any guess for who is Next?
[20:18:55] <ForbodenOden> long stream so no worries
[20:18:55] <nickjgrey> You'll be safe if you get Sam Smith on
[20:18:58] <bitparade> @BattleandBrew same, not sure I've seen you, do you not o the Spooky Sunday?
[20:19:04] <barcelonajames> you may be the most 'woke' person' in the world right now
[20:19:04] <franimall> Has Romesh been on ?
[20:19:06] <SpadgersHat> I hate that you even have to defend yourself, lads. It's been brilliant.
[20:19:07] <NadiaKamil> I'm available to come back on if you need a WOMAN who is also ARAB and FRUITY
[20:19:08] <eustace23> a "non-diversive stream" that had two men get married!
[20:19:12] <MskieRiot> AHKR sfg8bKingRob sfg8bAhkr3
[20:19:14] <solobinary> back wit cha ;p
[20:19:19] <prvix> I have kicked something off over on Twitter (deliberate pun) trying to get football buyers for Izzie, if anyone wants to join in
[20:19:23] <howlieTee> I spend a surprising amount of my life talking about this because of my job
[20:19:25] <chelseayoung2003> MOOD CHECK
[20:19:27] <caracompass> Also taking part is open to literally anyone lol
[20:19:30] <chez_ali> @ali3ghouse amazing work
[20:19:32] <lu326584> You've done loads Mark (Also, "Mark Watson talks a bit about life" on radio 4 had loads of women)
[20:19:33] <probablylucy> I am a female and I approve of Mark Watson
[20:19:38] <BattleAndBrew> @bitparade I'm on a different account rn but no I don't do sundays, I'm real inconsistant
[20:19:50] <chrisdfawcett> think about Werewolf! That was the ultimate diversity set!
[20:19:51] <lomode84> AHKR sfg8bAhkr3 sfg8bAhkr3 sfg8bAhkr3 sfg8bKingRob sfg8bKingRob sfg8bKingRob
[20:19:54] <crescentmoonrising> Compared to say, the avarage panel show, this is really diverse
[20:19:54] <kateweb2020> I really enjoyed Heidi’s escape room
[20:19:55] <barcelonajames> i do remember you misgendering calling jordan axis from awesome at one point durnig werefolf but it was 4am
[20:19:56] <howlieTee> Ultimately you can try your best and eventually overtime if you make an environment that encourages women then slowly but surely you get more
[20:19:58] <Ali3GHouse> Indeed! @chez_ali sfg8bHappy2 spkHype spkHype spkHype sfg8bAhkr3 sfg8bKingRob sfg8bAhkr3
[20:19:58] <wignomore> Need more cactii
[20:20:03] <bitparade> @BattleandBrew fair!
[20:20:10] <barcelonajames> cancel this immediately
[20:20:12] <chelseayoung2003> MOOOD CHEEEECK
[20:20:15] <howlieTee> @barcelonajames and he immediately apologised and corrected himself so...
[20:20:22] <caracompass> men pushing forward isn't an excuse but it is true in a lot of mixed groups. I don't think you were saying it as a positive or negative
[20:20:23] <lomode84> AHKR sfg8bKingRob sfg8bKingRob sfg8bKingRob sfg8bAhkr3 sfg8bAhkr3 sfg8bAhkr3
[20:20:30] <24hrbarney> Lol
[20:20:31] <Kirwinia> We got misgendered today and it really, really sucked. But you corrected yourself Mark?
[20:20:32] <josierustle> people make mistakes but at least you're aware of what you need to work on
[20:20:34] <Kirwinia> That makes you okay
[20:20:38] <hangingspaz> Mark, Sky Sports simulated the last day of the Championship season and Bristol City clinched a playoff place with a 2-1 victory over Preston - Let's toast to that!
[20:20:40] <barcelonajames> it's not a criticism @howlieTee don't worry it's all love
[20:20:46] <prvix> You're on the right side of History, Watson
[20:20:48] <bexturner20> @liamgreenjacket What a nice compliment! :)
[20:20:49] <matty_curry> I have a raspberry gin and tonic and I'm very tired. How is everyone?
[20:20:55] <caracompass> @howlietee you are spot on all the time, misha
[20:20:55] <franimall> @hangingspaz where did Derby come
[20:20:59] <comicfrankie> It was easier playing the go8bit with keyboard, I think
[20:20:59] <PlumbRoberta> Has Limmy joined in?
[20:20:59] <kateweb2020> Better at being a werewolf than playing Pac Man
[20:21:00] <mynameismelbert> Big Coffee time again.
[20:21:01] <flumcake> So, now that we've definitvely proven the stream isn't sexist, lets have a game of No More Women!
[20:21:01] <tonigunk> and most of us are regulars to Wifi Wars.....
[20:21:04] <chelseayoung2003> MOOD UPDATE
[20:21:06] <anastasia_beaverhausen> @hangingspaz wat about forest?
[20:21:07] <howlieTee> @barcelonajames I just feel really strongly that people ought to be allowed to apologise for their mistakes and be better
[20:21:09] <elquay> when you practice and you're used to it, gendering people correctly gets a lot easier
[20:21:12] <probablylucy> MOOD UPDATE
[20:21:13] <bexturner20> @matty_curry that sounds fantastic! What make is the gin?
[20:21:16] <chelseayoung2003> WOOOO
[20:21:17] <barcelonajames> completely agree
[20:21:23] <gemmac3> We think it’s been a wonderfully diverse and lovely show 😊
[20:21:23] <comicfrankie> No, Limmy was in chat but didn't have time to join the video
[20:21:23] <caracompass> @plumbroberts he said he can't join the stream unfortunately
[20:21:25] <chelseayoung2003> ALEX HYPE
[20:21:25] <howlieTee> @caracompass I blame spending so much time working in education

[20:21:39] <heidispidey> Mark I would make my room into an escape room another ten times for you, you’re wonderful (this is Heidi I don’t know if it says my name here)
[20:21:39] <Kirwinia> @WatsonComedy Thank you for correcting yourself when you misgendered someone. That's the right way to do it.

[20:42:11] <Gorilladrummer97> I approve of this idea @RufusHound
[20:42:18] <RufusHound> @thetedhill that we we can possibly claim to have been more successful than Children in Need
[20:42:23] <thetedhill> @RufusHound we certianly can
[20:42:28] <httpsterio> @RufusHound with my quick math, if they had 1mil viewers and 3 mil donations, that's 3 dollars per viewer.
[20:42:28] <seasider13> coronation street
[20:42:32] <RufusHound> @thetedhill Good man!
[20:42:32] <thetedhill> as in donations per person?

[20:43:35] <RufusHound> @chelseayoung2003 TBH I've never done a marathon show that didnt leave me feeling utter bliss. I guess I feel a bit bad, because Ive been less involved in the fringes of other people's stuff

[20:43:49] <katelilian> trumpet gal hype!

[20:48:35] <gwn2> @RufusHound perhaps there could be more money going to the cause if it weren't for the fact that there is a minimum £5 donation plus a £1 tip BibleThump i paid it but the cause might get more if u could donate less & if the £1 tip went to the cause
[20:48:36] <glasgow_sheep> Ian lyricist
[20:48:40] <Dr_Electr0> Maybe he meant the movie

[20:48:51] <stewtlee> ian lyrcist def up there
[20:48:54] <ewantough> It's just a few hours of cats introducing themselves
[20:49:03] <adamlarter> He's more of a Dogs person
[20:49:15] <chorleytheatre> Cats is the musical that Rice and Webber fell out over so probably why Tim can't be bothered
[20:49:21] <marajoyloves> The musical poster is just spooky eyes.

[20:49:27] <flumcake> You don't have to pay the tip, you can select Other and then put zero.
[20:49:30] <cubeisclown> Did he call Lion King big cats? Or did I dream that / was that the chat?
[20:49:30] <emersonyoung> I watched Cats drunk at 10pm a few months before the plague.
[20:49:31] <groggibear> No cats, only lions for Rice
[20:49:32] <howlieTee> Yeah it doesn’t have a narrative and it’s lovely for it
[20:49:36] <k8bd> I saw cats as a kid in the 80s and I was a bit bored...
[20:49:44] <probablylucy> I am a cat! and I am a cat! and I am also... Jason Derulo
[20:49:46] <guddjuni> bono not British
[20:49:46] <mynameismelbert> i love cats.
[20:49:52] <glasgow_sheep> @stewtlee don't think so
[20:49:53] <stewtlee> bono no thuman
[20:49:55] <prvix> Jason Deruuuuulo
[20:49:56] <ysrmahmood> Afternoon @RambleTash
[20:49:57] <mynameismelbert> wept twice. derulo's finest ohour.
[20:49:59] <katelilian> so he avoided cats by choice
[20:50:01] <mynameismelbert> hour
[20:50:02] <alexcross8888> We were so worried about whether Jellicles can and Jellicles do that we didn't stop to think whether Jellicles should
[20:50:02] <rainbowziggy> Next comedy marathon just get as many people on to introduce themselves for 24+ hours and NOTHING ELSE
[20:50:03] <josierustle> i still haven't seen the new film but the original late 90s film is great
[20:50:04] <mattywin85> Bring back Rice
[20:50:04] <lilmsredcheeks> maybe there's a tiger king cats musical on the way. ask Tim
[20:50:05] <daniel_2020__> We're still no closer to knowing how we would cast Watson in this?
[20:50:05] <andysmart79> Cats was terrible
[20:50:09] <franimall> I was in Cats at school. wwhen I was 8, the cat make-up was remarkably realistic
[20:50:13] <marajoyloves> Meow.
[20:50:13] <lachicalolita> I feel like my random question has created a tidal wave of issues...
[20:50:16] <andysmart79> movie was pants as well
[20:50:23] <rachelec_> The irony of you talking about Cats when I've just had to coax my neighbour's cat out from underneath my bed because she ran in the house!
[20:50:23] <probablylucy> That the CATS movie was the results of an argument does NOT surprise me
[20:50:28] <howlieTee> The problem is that no-one likes the replacement songs he wrote for the musicals revival
[20:50:31] <zerothim> Apparently in the original cut the cats had anatomically realistic anuses which had to be manually edited out in post production.
[20:50:31] <trumpetmike> Lloyd Webber would put in the worst possible tunes if he thought he would make money out of it
[20:50:33] <fatringer> COCKTAIL HOUR
[20:50:41] <alexisbeanquiff> cats are not interesting enough to carry a narrative

[20:51:12] <lunik1> @trumpetmike yeah, Cats
[20:51:16] <24hrbarney> does adding Angostura bitters to a G&T count as a cocktail?
[20:51:20] <franimall> is tea mixed with coffee a thing
[20:51:25] <wishihadacoolusername> I've just had 1.5hr break to run a quiz. back now. cocktails you say? 👍
[20:51:26] <comicfrankie> Don't forget about Adam Kay's extra hour!
[20:51:27] <CharlieMillerUK> toffee
[20:51:33] <RambleTash> Cats the original musical is good actually, general audiences are just too cowardly to appreciate complete and utter nonsense.
[20:51:34] <Pokebex> A cofftea
[20:51:37] <rflanagan2000> Remind me, what time is Lloyd Webber coming on?
[20:51:39] <howlieTee> Who else has been up the whole time still?
[20:51:39] <CarlRicko> What are the board games in the background?
[20:51:44] <fatringer> What about Adam Kays extra hour?
[20:51:45] <lilmsredcheeks> We're waiting for the Key/Hagen Dane off
[20:51:47] <josierustle> i can't imagine there'd be another real-life long show again but i'd love to experience one live
[20:51:48] <probablylucy> @franimall undoubtedly yes

[20:52:23] <kateweb2020> Isn’t there a rainbow baking challenge to judge?
[20:52:23] <kentishizzie> It's definitely lacking the group hysteria that the live show had, I'd say
[20:52:23] <lisain> do we have the bakers??
[20:52:23] <alexisbeanquiff> do we have the bakers??

[20:52:59] <Geertzilla> hey everyone, I baked a custard pie apparently 😬
[20:53:03] <em_llama> keep going cathy xx
[20:53:04] <yorkiepaul> How many been on since 9pm?? I have and think tiredness has now left the building, like delirium has too, just now wondering if could survive until Monday morning awake!
[20:53:08] <royshearer> yeah but thats the best she can do
[20:53:14] <kateweb2020> @geertzilla We have a baker!

[20:53:32] <josierustle> i've been on since 9pm, i think i can last till the end but it's definitely difficult
[20:53:32] <thetedhill> @RufusHound by my calcs, children in need 2019 raised £7.9 per viewer, we've got £15.17 per viewer, based on my estimation of our highest view count at any one time based on the average views per half hour. even if i end up messing that up massively, we made more than children in need per person allowing for a huge range of margins of errors
[20:53:35] <chez_ali> I baked a rainbow sponge :)
[20:53:35] <claire_faulkes> What about George Lazenby?
[20:53:37] <howlieTee> @yorkiepaul I’ve been on solidly, I’ve entered a weird zone

[21:23:19] <rayraychul> can you not just stay on standard twitch?
[21:23:21] <CazzaLaRouge> @radionoush i would like Key back too
[21:23:22] <biffolot> He’ll need something
[21:23:24] <caracompass> maybe it's for a specific thing? eg it's for as long as getting your hair chopped takes and not a new guests & chat thing?
[21:23:27] <rayraychul> just you on twitch with the chat?
[21:23:28] <richardvanch> I've got Fringe Progs back to my first in 1979. No standup was performed there until about 4 years later...
[21:23:29] <comicfrankie> You can still do it on twitch as a one-man show

[21:24:16] <joefleming25> To be honest the whole show is odd. Don't worry about that

[21:24:53] <josierustle> it's a lovely odd
[21:24:56] <chiefclues> nah its facebook.
[21:24:59] <lucyorchardcomedy> shappi does a great twitter stream
[21:25:01] <howlieTee> But there’s a reason Rob and Steve are in charge of the tech

[21:25:36] <MarkGrimshaw> I believe you could broadcast live on Twitter, and people wouldn't need to log in for that.
[21:25:37] <LauraLJS> Yes please to Sir Tim
[21:25:37] <MissGroucher> birng back tim, bring back tim, bring back tim
[21:25:39] <kateweb2020> Could we ask Alexis for a poem? His are excellent
[21:25:41] <sparkyrob_uk> Why not do it on Facebook Live from your page?
[21:25:44] <alfajones> Ask him
[21:25:45] <caitlin_mcaitlin> can you get izzie on stream?
[21:25:53] <cathypenrose> I wouldn't bother I think some people might be too tired. But what about Adam's donation?
[21:25:54] <guddjuni> Tim was great. yes to Tim
[21:25:55] <franimall> he could give the final total
[21:25:55] <alfajones> He did volunteer
[21:25:56] <Geertzilla> sing a little song, donate a million quid, you know
[21:25:57] <howlieTee> Being back all the time
[21:25:57] <tims925> did I see you at Bristol county grand watching cricket during the World Cup? fairly sure it was you!
[21:26:01] <Kirwinia> #watsonathon Think it'd be worth the hassle of publicly asking a comedian who majorly slighted us today for an apology, so we can salvage the day. Or: would it maybe backfire due to their fans?
[21:26:02] <howlieTee> *tim
[21:26:03] <lilmsredcheeks> yes Izzie would be GREAT
[21:26:06] <mazza021> How did he get Rice?
[21:26:08] <gabynj> you can do it on zoom or insta live - you can invite guests into insta live
[21:26:09] <josierustle> arthur smith's poems were lovely
[21:26:14] <josierustle> however long ago that was
[21:26:15] <lu326584> Tim to read out the final total money raised?
[21:26:18] <afbartley> could we get rice to like review flo and joans song? maybe we could get them a musical
[21:26:23] <nickjgrey> Tim and maybe his daughter Anneka #funlittleanecdote
[21:26:30] <rflanagan2000> Ahem, there is another room already setup ready for an after-party. Currently hosted by 2 aussies but ripe for occupation after
[21:26:32] <kateweb2020> @markgrimshaw I /think/ Twitter live only works through the app.

Yourself and everybody involved have done an incredible job, you’ve helped thousands take their mind off of this trying time, you’ve given a couple the wedding to remember for the rest of their lives, and you’ve cursed and damaged the brains of insomniacs. It’s truly been a comedic and heartwarming watch and I just wanted to thank you all for all of your hard work.

[1 day, 0:10:28] <wolfofdroolstreet> I just wanted to say, this has been the absolute highlight of the lockdown. Yourself and everybody involved have done an incredible job, you’ve helped thousands take their mind off of this trying time, you’ve given a couple the wedding to remember for the rest of their lives, and you’ve cursed and damaged the brains of insomniacs. It’s truly been a comedic and heartwarming watch and I just wanted to thank you all for all of your hard work.
